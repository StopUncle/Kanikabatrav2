# Neural AST Development Tools

This directory contains Neural AST engine integration files for advanced code analysis and generation.

## 🧠 Purpose

The `.neural-ast` directory houses tools for:
- Intelligent code analysis
- AST-based transformations
- Automated refactoring
- Code intelligence features

## 📁 Structure

```
.neural-ast/
├── experiments/      # AST transformation experiments
├── journal/         # Development journal and logs
└── README.md        # This file
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Code Analysis:** Deep understanding of code structure
- **Smart Transformations:** AST-based code modifications
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies code patterns and anti-patterns
- **Automated Refactoring:** Safe, intelligent code improvements

## 🔧 Integration

Connected to:
- Blueprint Architect system
- Development workflow
- Code quality tools
- Automated testing systems

## 📊 Directories

- **`experiments/`** - Testing new AST transformations and patterns
- **`journal/`** - Development logs and transformation history

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Files in this directory are managed by the Neural AST system
- Manual modifications should be avoided
- Used for development-time analysis only
- Not included in production builds
