  title: 'Architecture of Control',
  subtitle: 'The strings are invisible until you learn to see them.',
  description: 'Control is not about force—it is about architecture. The skilled operator builds structures that guide behavior without seeming to. This week, you learn the frameworks: intermittent reinforcement, frame control, and the subtle architecture that shapes every power dynamic.',

  tacticalBrief: {
    opening: 'The crudest form of control is the command. The most elegant form is the architecture that makes the desired behavior feel like the target\'s own idea. Casinos understand this—every element from carpet patterns to clock absence is designed to control behavior without a single order being given. Relationships have similar architecture.',

        title: 'Intermittent Reinforcement',
        content: 'Consistent rewards create satisfaction. Intermittent rewards create addiction. The slot machine does not pay every time—that is precisely why people cannot stop pulling the lever. In relationships, the person who is sometimes warm, sometimes cool, sometimes available, sometimes distant creates a powerful psychological pull. Predictability is comfortable. Unpredictability is addictive.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Frame Control',
        content: 'The frame is the invisible structure that defines what a situation means. Who decides if dinner is "a date" or "just friends catching up"? Who determines if the relationship is "casual" or "serious"? The person who sets the frame controls the interaction. Never accept someone else\'s frame without examination. Set your own frame first.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Push-Pull Dynamic',
        content: 'Constant pursuit creates resistance. Constant retreat creates abandonment. The push-pull alternates between advancing and withdrawing—warmth followed by slight cooling, attention followed by brief absence. This creates uncertainty that heightens emotional engagement. One step forward, half step back.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Strategic Unpredictability',
        content: 'Humans are pattern-recognition machines. When they cannot predict you, they become fascinated. Break your own patterns deliberately. If you always text good morning, skip a day. If you always accept invitations, decline one with no explanation. Unpredictability within a foundation of general reliability creates intrigue.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Strategic Narcolepsy',
        content: 'Against narcissists and drama-seekers, your weapon is disengagement. You "fall asleep" mid-tantrum—not literally, but your attention shuts off entirely. Your energy flatlines. You yawn. You check your phone. You go "beige." Their chaos meets a wall of pure indifference. Narcissists feed on emotional reactions. Deny them the meal.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Beige Protocol',
        content: 'One commandment: Never be interesting. If they want drama, you are tired. If they want a fight, you are "not sure what you mean." If they accuse, you say "Okay"—without tone. Your voice stays flat. Your face stays neutral. You become so boring, so unreactive, that staying engaged with you costs them more energy than they gain. They will seek supply elsewhere.',
