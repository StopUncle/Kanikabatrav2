  tacticalBrief: {
    opening: 'There is a moment in every power dynamic when withdrawal becomes the most powerful move. Not retreat in defeat—strategic repositioning. The person who advances when they should withdraw appears desperate. The person who withdraws at the right moment creates longing, demonstrates value, and shifts the entire dynamic in their favor.',

        title: 'The Withdrawal as Leverage',
        content: 'Your presence is only valuable if your absence is felt. When you are always there, always available, always pursuing—your presence becomes background noise. Strategic withdrawal makes your presence valuable again. The person reaches for what is pulling away, not what is pushing toward them.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Reading the Withdrawal Moment',
        content: 'The time to withdraw is NOT when you are losing—that is just losing. The time to withdraw is at peak engagement—when they are most interested, most responsive, most invested. Leave them wanting more, not glad you left. Exit on a high note, not a desperate scramble.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Withdrawal Without Explanation',
        content: 'The power of withdrawal is in the mystery. "Where did they go? Why are they distant? Did I do something?" An explained absence resolves the tension; an unexplained one maintains it. You do not owe anyone an explanation for prioritizing yourself. Simply become less available.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Reappearance',
        content: 'Strategic withdrawal requires strategic reappearance. Return when they have felt your absence, not immediately when they reach out. Return as though nothing happened—no explanation, no drama, just confident re-engagement. The cycle of withdrawal and return creates powerful psychological anchoring.',
      },
      {
        title: 'The Reverse Chase',
        content: 'Against avoidant types, your weapon is withdrawal. The Dismissive Avoidant expects you to pursue—their entire system is built on being the pursued, not the pursuer. Stop chasing. Become less available than they are. Out-independent the independent. When you flip the script, their fear of losing control activates. Suddenly they are reaching for what is slipping away.',
      },
      {
        title: 'Weaponized Unpredictability',
        content: 'The Fearful Avoidant creates chaos to feel in control. They expect push-pull from you—pursuit followed by frustration. Instead, become the stable center they cannot destabilize. Do not react to their tests. Do not chase when they pull away. Do not push when they return. Your calm consistency is the opposite of what their chaos addiction craves.',
