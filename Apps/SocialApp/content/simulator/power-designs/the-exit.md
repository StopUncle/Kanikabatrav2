- **Estimated Scenes**: 26-32
- **Category**: Career transition, negotiation, reputation protection

---

## Logline

You've decided to leave. Maybe you have an offer, maybe you're just done. But leaving well is an art—one final negotiation where you maximize severance, protect your reputation, secure references, and position for what's next. The two weeks from decision to departure are the most strategically important of your career. Leave poorly, and it follows you. Leave well, and you've added a weapon to your arsenal.

---

## Core Theme

**How you leave determines what you take with you.** This scenario teaches:
- Resignation strategy and timing
- Counter-offer navigation
- Severance and garden leave negotiation
- Reference and reputation protection
- Non-compete and NDA management
- The art of the graceful exit

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Exit Reality
Most people leave jobs poorly because they're emotional. Understanding:
1. The resignation conversation is a negotiation
2. Counter-offers are rarely worth taking
3. Your leverage peaks the moment you resign
4. How you leave affects future references
5. Non-competes and NDAs are negotiable

### The Exit Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Your Leverage | Priority |
|-------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Pre-announcement** | Days before | Maximum | Prepare all documentation |
| **Resignation** | Day 1 | Very high | Execute the conversation |
| **Counter-offer period** | Days 1-3 | High | Navigate carefully |
| **Notice period** | 2-4 weeks | Declining | Extract value, protect reputation |
| **Post-departure** | Ongoing | Variable | Maintain relationships |

### Professional vs Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional | Dark Arts |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Timing announcement | Standard two weeks | Strategic timing for maximum leverage |
| Counter-offer | Honest consideration | Use as leverage for new offer |
| Knowledge transfer | Complete handover | Strategic withholding of key knowledge |
| References | Request after departure | Secure in writing during negotiation |
| Non-compete | Sign what's presented | Negotiate scope aggressively |

Standard two-week notice?
The team is ready for you."

NARRATION:
Before you resign, what do you need to lock down?
```

**Choice 1 - PREPARATION**:
1. **Get everything in writing**: Request written offer, start date flexibility, full terms. (+25 NEW_OPPORTUNITY_SECURED)

3. **Start immediately**: Accept and resign tomorrow. (+10 speed, -15 preparation)

Once you resign, access could be cut.
Secure everything now.

NARRATION:
What do you prioritize?
```

---

```
[When you resign matters]

Monday morning? End of week?
Before the board meeting or after?
During the critical project or between phases?

INNER VOICE:
Timing affects their reaction.
And your leverage.

NARRATION:
When do you announce?
```

**Choice 3**:
1. **Monday morning**: Clean start to the week, professional. (+15 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)
2. **Friday afternoon**: Gives them weekend to process. (+10 defuses emotion)
3. **After bonus payout**: Wait for the check to clear. (+20 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
4. **During critical project**: Maximum leverage—they need you. (+25 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED, -15 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)

---

### PART 2: THE RESIGNATION

#### Scene 4: The Resignation Conversation
**Location**: marcus-office

```
[You request a private meeting with Marcus]

YOU:
"I wanted to tell you directly.
I've accepted an offer elsewhere.
I'm resigning."

[Silence]

MARCUS:
"I... didn't see this coming.
How long have you been looking?"

INNER VOICE:
The first question is always about them.
How they missed it.

MARCUS:
"Is there anything that would change your mind?"
```

**Choice 4 - KEY MOMENT**:
1. **Door closed**: "I've made my decision. I want to make this transition smooth." (+20 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED, ends counter-offer path)
2. **Door open**: "I'm listening. What did you have in mind?" (+30 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED, opens counter-offer)
3. **Honest reason**: "I'll tell you what led to this decision." (+15 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED, +10 authenticity)
4. **Strategic vagueness**: "It's the right move for my career." (+10 protects new job info)

---

#### Scene 5: The Counter-Offer
**Location**: marcus-office (if door was open)

```
[Two hours later, Marcus returns]

MARCUS:
"I talked to leadership.
We don't want to lose you.

20% raise. Promotion to Director.
A project team of your own."

[He slides a paper across]

MARCUS:
"This is serious.
We're investing in you."

INNER VOICE:
The counter-offer.
More than expected.
But is it real?

NARRATION:
How do you respond?
```

**Choice 5 - COUNTER-OFFER NAVIGATION**:
1. **Decline immediately**: "I appreciate this. My decision is made." (+15 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED, +20 clean exit)
2. **Use as leverage**: "Let me think about it—and see if my new offer can be improved." (+30 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED, risky with both)
3. **Negotiate higher**: "If you could match the title at the other company, I'd consider it." (+20 pushes for more)
4. **Accept the counter**: "This changes things. I'll stay." (→ Counter-offer accepted path, high risk)

---

#### Scene 6: The Counter-Offer Truth
**Location**: office (reflection)

```
[If considering the counter-offer]

INNER VOICE:
Here's what they don't tell you:
80% of people who accept counter-offers
leave within 18 months anyway.

Your loyalty is now questioned.
The problems that made you leave haven't changed.
This money was always available—they just didn't offer it.

[Data]
- Average tenure post-counter: 18 months
- Promotion delay for "flight risks": 2x longer
- Reference quality from counter-accepters: lower

NARRATION:
What does this mean for your decision?
```

---

#### Scene 7: HR Negotiation
**Location**: hr-office

```
[Victoria, HR Director]

VICTORIA:
"Marcus tells me you're leaving.
Let's discuss the transition."

[She opens a folder]

VICTORIA:
"Your standard package: two weeks notice,
payout of accrued PTO,
standard reference policy."

[pause]

VICTORIA:
"Is there anything you'd like to discuss?"

INNER VOICE:
There's always flexibility.
You just have to ask.
```

**Choice 6 - NEGOTIATION**:
1. **Push for more**: "I'd like to discuss garden leave, accelerated vesting, and an enhanced reference letter." (+30 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
2. **Non-compete reduction**: "I'd like the non-compete modified to exclude my new role." (+25 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
3. **Extended departure**: "A month of transition would ensure a smooth handover—with appropriate compensation." (+20 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
4. **Accept standard**: "That sounds fine." (-20 DEPARTURE_TERMS, missed opportunity)

---

#### Scene 8: The Non-Compete Discussion
**Location**: hr-office (continued)

```
[The non-compete comes up]

VICTORIA:
"Your non-compete has a 12-month restriction
on working for competitors."

[She watches you]

VICTORIA:
"Is your new role... potentially conflicting?"

INNER VOICE:
This is where it gets serious.
Non-competes are often paper tigers.
But not always.

NARRATION:
How do you handle this?
```

**Choice 7**:
1. **Request waiver**: "I'd like a formal waiver for my new role specifically." (+25 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
2. **Negotiate scope**: "The non-compete is overbroad. Let's narrow it to actual competitors." (+20 DEPARTURE_TERMS)
3. **Strategic vagueness**: "My new role is in a different space. There's no conflict." (+10 avoids confrontation)
4. **Call their bluff**: "We both know these are rarely enforced. I'm not concerned." (+15 aggressive, risky)

---

### PART 3: THE DEPARTURE

#### Scene 9: The Transition
**Location**: office

```
[You have two weeks]

NARRATION:
The work continues.
But everyone knows you're leaving.

Some colleagues are supportive.
Some are distant.
Some are already jockeying for your role.

ELENA:
"I'm happy to take over your accounts.
You know, to make this easier for you."

INNER VOICE:
She's been waiting for this.

NARRATION:
How do you handle the transition?
```

**Choice 8**:
1. **Full documentation**: Create comprehensive handover materials. (+25 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED, +20 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)
2. **Selective sharing**: Document the basics, keep key relationships personal. (+20 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED)
3. **Protect your people**: Ensure your team is positioned well after you leave. (+30 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)
4. **Check out early**: Do the minimum, mentally you're already gone. (-25 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)

---

#### Scene 10: The Reference Conversation
**Location**: marcus-office

```
[You request a meeting with Marcus]

YOU:
"I want to make sure we leave this right.
Would you be willing to serve as a reference?"

MARCUS:
"Of course."

[pause]

MARCUS:
"What would you want me to say?"

INNER VOICE:
This is the moment.
Get it in writing.

NARRATION:
How do you secure this?
```

**Choice 9**:
1. **Get it in writing**: "Would you put something in writing I could share with future employers?" (+30 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)
2. **Verbal commitment**: "I just wanted to confirm you'd speak positively about my work." (+15 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)
3. **LinkedIn recommendation**: "A LinkedIn recommendation would be great." (+20 REPUTATION_PROTECTED)
4. **Don't push**: "Just knowing you're willing is enough." (+5 REPUTATION_PROTECTED, missed opportunity)

---

#### Scene 11: The CEO Intervention
**Location**: executive-floor (Victor Sterling intercepts)

```
[Unexpected summons from Victor Sterling]

VICTOR:
"I heard you're leaving.
That's a mistake."

[He gestures for you to sit]

VICTOR:
"I've been watching your work.
You're ready for more than Marcus can offer.

What if I told you there's a VP role
opening in six months?
And your name was on my list."

INNER VOICE:
Is this real?
Or is this retention theatre?

VICTOR:
"Think about it.
Your new company can wait."
```

**Choice 10**:
1. **Decline gracefully**: "I'm honored. But I've made a commitment I intend to keep." (+25 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)
2. **Ask for details**: "Tell me more about the role and timeline." (+20 gathers information)
3. **Call the bluff**: "If I was on your list, why am I hearing about it now?" (+15 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED)
4. **Negotiate**: "Put it in writing with a timeline, and I'll consider it." (+30 LEVERAGE_UTILIZED)

---

#### Scene 12: The Last Day
**Location**: office (packing up)

```
[Your desk is clear. The badge goes in a basket.]

NARRATION:
Two years. Or five. Or fifteen.
Reduced to a cardboard box and a goodbye email.

INNER VOICE:
You did it right.
The severance is signed.
The references are secured.
The relationships are intact.

[Colleagues stop by]
[Some are genuine, some are performative]
[All of them are watching how you leave]

NARRATION:
One last task: the goodbye message.
What tone do you strike?
```

**Choice 11 - FINAL IMPRESSION**:
1. **Gracious professional**: Thank the company, the team, express gratitude for growth. (+30 REPUTATION_PROTECTED, +20 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)
2. **Personal and selective**: Individual messages to people who mattered, brief public note. (+25 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)
3. **Forward-looking**: Brief note focusing on the future, not the past. (+15 clean break)
4. **Minimal**: Quick email, fast exit. Don't look back. (+5 efficient, -10 RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED)

---

## Endings

### EXCELLENT EXIT

**1. The Perfect Departure**
**Trigger**: High all stats, bridges intact, package maximized

```
NARRATION:
You left well.
Severance negotiated. References in writing.
Non-compete waived. Relationships preserved.

Six months later, Marcus reaches out for advice.
Elena asks to connect for a coffee.
Victor remembers you favorably.

INNER VOICE:
You joined on their terms.
You left on yours.

LESSON:
The exit is the final negotiation.
Most people give it away.
You didn't.
```

---

**2. The Bridge Builder**
**Trigger**: High RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED, smooth transition

```
NARRATION:
The handover was seamless.
Your team is positioned well.
Your replacement thanks you.

Years later, these relationships pay dividends.
Referrals. Introductions. Opportunities.

INNER VOICE:
You could have burned it.
You chose to build instead.
That choice compounds.

LESSON:
How you leave is how you're remembered.
Legacy lasts longer than leverage.
```

---

### GOOD EXIT

**3. Got What You Needed**
**Trigger**: Strong DEPARTURE_TERMS, moderate relationship impact

```
NARRATION:
The negotiation worked.
Garden leave. Accelerated vesting. Non-compete reduced.

Some feelings were bruised.
But that's business.

INNER VOICE:
You pushed.
You won.
Not everyone loved it.
That's okay.

LESSON:
Sometimes the relationship cost is worth it.
Know what you're trading.
```

---

**4. Clean But Quick**
**Trigger**: Moderate stats, no drama

```
NARRATION:
Standard exit. Standard package.
Two weeks, handshake, goodbye.

No enemies made. No bridges burned.
No exceptional terms either.

INNER VOICE:
You left money on the table.
But you left clean.
There's value in that too.

LESSON:
Not every exit needs to be maximized.
Sometimes clean is enough.
```

---

### COMPLICATED

**5. Counter-Offer Accepted**
**Trigger**: Accepted counter-offer

```
NARRATION:
You stayed.
The raise was real. The promotion happened.

But something changed.
They know you considered leaving.
You know they only paid you when you forced it.

INNER VOICE:
18 months.
That's the average tenure after a counter.
The clock is ticking.

LESSON:
Counter-offers address symptoms.
They rarely fix the disease.
```

---

**6. Burned the Bridge**
**Trigger**: Low RELATIONSHIP_PRESERVED

```
NARRATION:
You got what you wanted.
Maybe more than you deserved.

But the exit was ugly.
Words were said. Emails were sharp.
Marcus won't take your calls.

INNER VOICE:
You won the negotiation.
You lost the relationship.
Was it worth it?

LESSON:
The world is smaller than you think.
Today's enemy is tomorrow's gatekeeper.
```

---

### POOR EXIT

**7. Left Empty-Handed**
**Trigger**: Didn't negotiate, accepted minimum

```
NARRATION:
Standard package. Minimum notice.
No reference letter. Generic goodbye.

Elena got your accounts.
Your team is worried.
No one remembers your last email.

INNER VOICE:
You had leverage.
You didn't use it.
That's on you.

LESSON:
The exit is the last opportunity to negotiate.
If you don't ask, you don't get.
```

---

**8. The Botched Exit**
**Trigger**: Multiple failures - burned bridges, poor terms

```
NARRATION:
The exit was a disaster.
You announced too early. Gave too much notice.
The counter-offer backfired.
The new job pushed back the start date.

Three months of awkward limbo.

INNER VOICE:
You misplayed every card.
Learn from it.

LESSON:
Preparation matters.
Timing matters.
Execution matters.
You can't wing the exit.
```

---

## Technical Notes

### Exit Negotiation Levers
```typescript
exitLevers = {
  garden_leave: { value: 'high', trigger: 'sensitive_role' },
  accelerated_vesting: { value: 'very_high', trigger: 'equity_at_stake' },
  non_compete_waiver: { value: 'high', trigger: 'competitor_move' },
  enhanced_reference: { value: 'medium', trigger: 'request' },
  extended_benefits: { value: 'medium', trigger: 'negotiation' }
}
```

### Counter-Offer Statistics
```typescript
counterOfferStats = {
  acceptance_rate: 50%,
  retention_at_18_months: 20%,
  promotion_delay: '2x longer than peers',
  trust_recovery: 'rare',
  recommended: false
}
```

### Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Resignation
"I've accepted an offer elsewhere. I wanted to tell you directly."

// Declining counter
"I appreciate this. My decision is made."

// Negotiating exit
"I'd like to discuss garden leave, accelerated vesting, and a reference letter."

// Final message
"Thank you for the opportunity to grow here."
```

### Inner Voice Style
- Strategic: "Your leverage peaks the moment you resign. Use it."
- Honest: "Counter-offers fix symptoms, not diseases."
- Forward: "How you leave determines what you take with you."
