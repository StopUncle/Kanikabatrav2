# The Interview

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: Universal (Free with Premium depth)
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Estimated Scenes**: 28-35
- **Category**: Job acquisition, persuasion, negotiation

---

## Logline

You're in the waiting room. Three rounds of interviews. One offer. The person before you just walked out smiling. In the next two hours, every word you say, every pause, every handshake will be analyzed. This isn't a conversation—it's a performance. And the only acceptable outcome is the offer.

---

## Core Theme

**The interview is not about answering questions—it's about controlling the narrative.** This scenario teaches:
- How to read interviewers and adapt in real-time
- The difference between answering a question and using a question
- Salary negotiation as a power dynamic, not a request
- When to show vulnerability and when to project dominance
- The dark arts of making them want you before you've said a word

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Interview Power Dynamic
Most candidates approach interviews as supplicants—grateful for the opportunity, desperate to please. Winners approach interviews as mutual evaluations where THEY hold leverage.

### Key Frameworks

**1. The Primacy Effect**
First 30 seconds determine 80% of the outcome. The handshake, the eye contact, the first sentence—everything else is confirmation bias.

**2. The Contrast Principle**
You're not being evaluated in isolation—you're being compared to everyone else they've seen. Make the comparison work for you.

**3. Strategic Vulnerability**
Perfection is unrelatable. A carefully chosen "weakness" humanizes you and builds trust. The key: pick a weakness that's actually a strength in disguise.

**4. The Scarcity Play**
Mention competing offers. Mention you're "exploring options." Never seem desperate. Desperation is the death of leverage.

**5. Anchoring in Negotiation**
The first number spoken sets the range. Let them anchor low, you lose. Anchor high with confidence, you win.

### Professional vs. Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional Approach | Dark Arts Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Weakness question | Genuine growth area you're working on | Strategic weakness that makes you look good |
| Why leaving current job? | Seeking growth opportunity | Subtle hint that you're being poached/courted |
| Salary expectation | Research-based range | High anchor with competing offer implication |
| Handling hostile interviewer | Stay calm, answer directly | Mirror their energy back, establish dominance |

## Characters

### You (The Candidate)
Qualified for the role. But so are six other people. The difference is how you perform.

### The Interviewers

#### Victoria Chen - HR Screening (Round 1)
**Role**: Gatekeeper. Decides if you're worth the hiring manager's time.
**Style**: Friendly but efficient. Looking for red flags.
**Tells**: Glances at clock = losing interest. Leans forward = engaged. Takes notes = good sign.

**Voice Example**:
> "So, tell me a little about yourself and what drew you to this role."

**What She's Really Asking**: Can you communicate clearly? Are you a culture fit? Will you cause drama?

---

#### Marcus Webb - Hiring Manager (Round 2)
**Role**: Decision maker. Your future boss.
**Style**: Can swing between friendly and challenging. Tests under pressure.
**Tells**: Arms crossed = skeptical. Nods while you speak = agreement. Silence after answer = wants more.

**Voice Example**:
> "I see you led the Henderson project. Walk me through a time when that project was about to fail and what you did."

**What He's Really Asking**: Can you handle pressure? Do you take ownership? Will you make me look good?

---

#### Diana Reeves - Senior Director (Round 3)
**Role**: Final approval. Looking at big picture fit.
**Style**: Poker face. Gives nothing away. Power player.
**Tells**: Checks phone = you've lost her. Asks follow-up questions = interested. Mentions future = you're in.

**Voice Example**:
> "Where do you see yourself in five years?"

**What She's Really Asking**: Are you ambitious enough to be useful but not so ambitious you'll threaten me?

---

#### James (The Competitor)
Walks out of interview room before you walk in. Confident. Well-dressed. Smiling.
**Role**: Psychological pressure. The contrast principle in action.

---

### Rachel (Your Inside Contact) - Text Support
A friend who works at the company. Feeds you intel between rounds.

**Voice Example**:
> "Marcus is a straight shooter but he HATES buzzwords. Also Diana's team just lost someone senior. They're desperate but don't let them know you know."

---

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: THE WAITING ROOM

#### Scene 1: Arrival
**Location**: office-lobby (new background needed or use apartment)

```
NARRATION:
9:47 AM. Thirteen minutes early. Perfect.

The lobby is all glass and steel. A wall of awards.
The kind of place that wants you to feel small.

INNER VOICE:
Don't. You're not here to beg. You're here to evaluate
if THEY deserve YOU.

[A door opens. A man in a perfect suit walks out.
Confident stride. Shakes the receptionist's hand warmly.]

JAMES: [to receptionist, happy]
"Thanks so much. Really enjoyed the conversation."

[He notices you. Sizes you up. Smiles.]

JAMES: [to you, slightly smug]
"Good luck in there."

INNER VOICE:
The competition. Designed to rattle you.
Don't let it.
```

**Choice 1**:
1. "Thanks. I'm sure I won't need it." - Confident counter (+10 POWER_POSITION)
2. "Thanks, you too." - Neutral, professional
3. "How was it?" - Seek intel (risky - shows uncertainty)
4. Nod and say nothing - Power move (+5 POWER_POSITION, -5 RAPPORT)

---

#### Scene 2: The Receptionist Test
**Location**: office-lobby

```
[You approach the front desk. The receptionist looks up.]

RECEPTIONIST: [neutral, polite]
"You must be [Name]. Can I get you anything?
Water? Coffee? The team is just finishing up."

INNER VOICE:
This is a test. Receptionists report to HR.
How you treat "invisible" people matters.

NARRATION:
You've heard stories. Candidates rejected because
they were rude to the receptionist. Paranoid? Maybe.
But paranoia keeps you employed.
```

**Choice 2**:
1. "Water would be great, thank you. How's your morning going?" - Warm, human (+5 RAPPORT, good first impression)
2. "I'm fine, thanks." - Efficient, professional
3. "Just water." - Neutral (no points)
4. Ignore them, check your phone - Fatal error (+1 RED_FLAGS, -15 RAPPORT)

---

#### Scene 3: Rachel's Intel
**Location**: text-screen

```
[Your phone buzzes. It's Rachel.]

RACHEL:
"You there yet?"

YOU:
"In the lobby. Just saw some Ken doll leave looking pleased."

RACHEL:
"Ignore him. Probably bombed and doesn't know it.

Quick intel: Victoria (HR) is first. She's nice but she's LOOKING
for red flags. Don't overshare.

Marcus (your potential boss) is second. Direct. Hates fluff.
Use numbers and specifics.

Diana is last. She's intimidating but she's also desperate.
Her best PM just left for a competitor. They NEED someone.

But don't let them know you know that."

INNER VOICE:
Information asymmetry. Your secret weapon.
```

---

#### Scene 4: The Walk In
**Location**: office-lobby → meeting-room

```
[Victoria Chen appears. Warm smile. Firm handshake extended.]

VICTORIA: [happy, professional]
"[Name]? I'm Victoria. Thanks for coming in."

INNER VOICE:
The handshake. The first 30 seconds. Make them count.

[You stand. This is it.]

NARRATION:
Eye contact. Firm (not crushing) grip.
Genuine smile. Not too eager.
First impression is loading...
```

**Choice 3**:
1. Mirror her energy exactly - warm, professional, matching (+10 RAPPORT, FLAG: strong_opening)
2. Dial up the confidence - firmer handshake, slight dominance (+10 POWER_POSITION, -5 RAPPORT)
3. Dial up the warmth - extra friendly, enthusiastic (+5 RAPPORT, risk of seeming eager)
4. Overthink it and fumble slightly (-10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, +1 RED_FLAGS)

---

### PART 2: ROUND 1 - HR SCREENING

#### Scene 5: Tell Me About Yourself
**Location**: meeting-room

```
VICTORIA: [neutral, pen ready]
"So, tell me a little about yourself and what
drew you to this role."

INNER VOICE:
The most important question. And the easiest to fail.

This is not your life story. This is a highlight reel.
Present-past-future. 90 seconds max.

NARRATION:
What story do you tell?
```

**Choice 4**:
1. **The Strategist**: Focus on relevant experience + why this role is the logical next step (+15 PERCEIVED_VALUE, +10 COMPETENCE_SHOWN)
2. **The Passionate**: Lead with enthusiasm for the company/mission (+10 RAPPORT, +5 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
3. **The Humble Brag**: Achievements presented as "learning experiences" (+5 PERCEIVED_VALUE, +5 RAPPORT)
4. **The Life Story**: Start from college, cover everything chronologically (-10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, Victoria checks clock)

---

#### Scene 6: The Weakness Trap
**Location**: meeting-room

```
VICTORIA:
"What would you say is your biggest weakness?"

INNER VOICE:
Ah. The classic.

"I work too hard" is transparent bullshit.
"I have crippling anxiety" is a red flag.

The answer: a real weakness that you're actively
addressing... or a strength disguised as a weakness.

NARRATION:
What's your move?
```

**Choice 5**:
1. **The Strategic Weakness**: "I can be too detail-oriented. I'm learning to delegate and trust my team." (+10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, FLAG: weakness_handled_well)
2. **The Honest Answer**: Share a genuine weakness and how you're working on it (+5 RAPPORT, +5 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
3. **The Dodge**: "My biggest weakness is that I care too much." (Victoria's eyes glaze over, -5 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
4. **The Dark Arts**: "My old manager said I make others look bad by comparison. Still working on dimming my light." (Risky: +15 POWER_POSITION or -10 RAPPORT depending on Victoria's read)

---

#### Scene 7: The Salary Trap
**Location**: meeting-room

```
VICTORIA:
"Before we go further, I want to make sure we're aligned.
What are your salary expectations for this role?"

INNER VOICE:
Trap. If you answer low, you've anchored yourself into poverty.
If you go high without justification, you look delusional.
If you dodge entirely, you look evasive.

NARRATION:
The anchoring game begins.
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **High Anchor + Justification**: "Based on the scope and my experience, I'm looking at $[X+20%]. I'm seeing similar offers in that range." (+20 POWER_POSITION, FLAG: salary_anchored_high)
2. **Range with Flexibility**: "I'm open. My research shows $X-$Y for this role. What's the budget?" (+10 POWER_POSITION, gives you info)
3. **Deflect to Value**: "I'd rather understand the full scope before discussing numbers. Can you tell me more about the role?" (Neutral - delays but doesn't anchor)
4. **Give a Low Number**: "I'm currently at $X, so anything above that works." (You just cost yourself $30K, -20 POWER_POSITION)

---

### PART 3: ROUND 2 - HIRING MANAGER

#### Scene 8: Marcus Enters
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Victoria leaves. Marcus Webb enters. Different energy entirely.
Direct eye contact. No smile. Assessing.]

MARCUS: [neutral, intense]
"[Name]. I've reviewed your resume. Let's cut to the chase."

[He sits. Opens a folder. Your resume is covered in notes.]

MARCUS:
"The Henderson project. You led that?"

INNER VOICE:
No warmth. No preamble. He's testing if you can match his energy.

Mirror him. Direct. Confident. No filler words.
```

---

#### Scene 9: The Behavioral Deep Dive
**Location**: meeting-room

```
MARCUS:
"Tell me about a time you failed. Not a 'learning experience.'
An actual failure."

INNER VOICE:
The real failure question. He wants to see if you own your shit.

NARRATION:
What story do you tell?

A failure where you learned something?
A failure where someone else was actually to blame?
A failure where you turned it around?
```

**Choice 7**:
1. **Own It Completely**: Share a real failure, what you learned, how you'd do it differently (+15 RAPPORT, +10 COMPETENCE_SHOWN)
2. **Failure + Redemption Arc**: A failure that led to an even bigger success (+10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, +10 COMPETENCE_SHOWN)
3. **Subtle Blame Shift**: A failure where context/others contributed (Marcus's eyes narrow, -5 RAPPORT, +1 RED_FLAGS)
4. **Dark Arts - The Humble Win**: "I failed to speak up when I saw the Henderson project going wrong. I was too junior. Now I don't stay quiet." (+15 POWER_POSITION)

---

#### Scene 10: The Hostile Moment
**Location**: meeting-room

```
MARCUS: [leaning forward, challenging]
"Looking at your background, you don't have direct experience
in [specific technical area]. How do you expect to hit
the ground running?"

INNER VOICE:
He's poking your weak spot. Deliberately.

Don't get defensive. Don't over-explain.
Own it or flip it.

NARRATION:
Your credentials are being questioned directly.
```

**Choice 8**:
1. **Acknowledge and Bridge**: "You're right, I haven't done X specifically. But I've done Y and Z, which require the same core skills. I learn fast." (+10 COMPETENCE_SHOWN, +5 RAPPORT)
2. **Flip It**: "I've found that specific experience matters less than problem-solving ability. In my last role, I was hired without X experience and outperformed people who had it." (+15 POWER_POSITION, +10 COMPETENCE_SHOWN, FLAG: dominated_hostile_moment)
3. **Get Defensive**: "Well, I mean, the job description didn't require that specifically..." (-10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, Marcus leans back)
4. **Overcompensate**: Launch into a detailed explanation of every adjacent experience (Marcus checks his watch, -5 COMPETENCE_SHOWN)

---

#### Scene 11: Reading Marcus
**Location**: meeting-room

```
NARRATION:
You've been talking for twenty minutes.
How's it going? You need to read him.

[Marcus is tapping his pen. He hasn't smiled.
But he also hasn't cut you off.]

INNER VOICE:
What's his body language telling you?

Tapping pen = impatient? Or processing?
No smile = skeptical? Or just his style?
He keeps asking follow-ups = digging for problems? Or interested?

NARRATION:
You have a chance to course-correct. Take it?
```

**Choice 9**:
1. **Ask Directly**: "I want to make sure I'm giving you what you need. What questions do you still have?" (+10 RAPPORT, shows self-awareness)
2. **Stay the Course**: Keep answering his questions as they come (neutral)
3. **Shift to Offense**: "Can I ask YOU something? What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?" (+10 POWER_POSITION, shows you're evaluating them)
4. **Show Uncertainty**: "How am I doing? Am I on the right track?" (-10 POWER_POSITION, FLAG: seemed_desperate)

---

### PART 4: ROUND 3 - THE FINAL BOSS

#### Scene 12: Diana Enters
**Location**: meeting-room (or executive-office)

```
[Diana Reeves enters. Power suit. Poker face.
She doesn't offer a handshake. She sits.]

DIANA: [neutral, unreadable]
"I've heard good things from Victoria and Marcus.
I have a few questions of my own."

INNER VOICE:
The final boss. Gives nothing away.
You can't read her. So don't try.

Just perform. Make every word count.

DIANA:
"Where do you see yourself in five years?"

INNER VOICE:
The real question: Are you ambitious enough to be useful?
Are you too ambitious to be safe?
```

**Choice 10**:
1. **Ambitious but Loyal**: "Leading a team here, driving the kind of results that get me in rooms like this one." (+10 PERCEIVED_VALUE, +10 RAPPORT)
2. **Strategically Vague**: "Growing with a company where I can make impact. I'm more focused on the work than the title." (+5 RAPPORT, +5 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
3. **Dark Arts - Her Shoes**: "Honestly? I'd love to be doing what you're doing. How did you get here?" (Flattery + flip to her story, +15 RAPPORT)
4. **Too Ambitious**: "Running my own division, ideally. Maybe VP within three years." (Diana's jaw tightens slightly, -10 RAPPORT)

---

#### Scene 13: Your Questions for Them
**Location**: meeting-room

```
DIANA:
"What questions do you have for us?"

INNER VOICE:
This is not optional. "No questions" = you're out.

But the questions you ask reveal what you value.

Asking about vacation days = you're not serious.
Asking about their challenges = you're thinking like an insider.
```

**Choice 11**:
1. **The Strategic Question**: "What's the biggest challenge facing this team right now?" (Shows you're thinking about how to help, +15 PERCEIVED_VALUE, FLAG: asked_great_questions)
2. **The Future Question**: "Where do you see this role evolving in the next two years?" (+10 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
3. **The Culture Question**: "What do you wish you'd known before joining?" (Humanizes the conversation, +10 RAPPORT)
4. **The Money Question**: "What's the bonus structure like?" (Diana's face hardens slightly, -5 PERCEIVED_VALUE)

---

#### Scene 14: The Salary Negotiation
**Location**: meeting-room

```
DIANA:
"We're prepared to make you an offer.
The base would be $[X - 15% from what you anchored].
Plus standard benefits and 10% bonus potential."

INNER VOICE:
They went low. Of course they did.

Now the game begins. You have leverage—they made an offer.
That means they want you. Use it.

NARRATION:
How do you respond?
```

**Choice 12 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Counter High + Silence**: "I appreciate that. To make this work, I'd need $[X+10%]. [Then stop talking. Let the silence work.]" (+25 POWER_POSITION, high risk/high reward)
2. **Counter with Competing Offer**: "I'm weighing another offer at $[X+5%]. I'd prefer to work here, but the numbers need to align." (+20 POWER_POSITION, FLAG: competing_offer_mentioned)
3. **Ask for Time**: "Thank you. I'd like to review this carefully. When do you need an answer?" (+10 POWER_POSITION, reduces pressure)
4. **Accept**: "That sounds great. When do I start?" (-20 POWER_POSITION, you left money on the table)
5. **Negotiate Beyond Base**: "The base is close. Can we discuss sign-on bonus and equity?" (+15 POWER_POSITION, shows sophistication)

---

#### Scene 15: The Close
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Final moments. Diana stands.]

DIANA: [neutral, thawing slightly]
"We'll be in touch by end of week."

INNER VOICE:
Last impression. Make it count.

[She offers her hand.]

NARRATION:
How do you leave?
```

**Choice 13**:
1. **Confident Close**: Firm handshake. "I'm looking forward to it." Hold eye contact. Then walk out without looking back. (+10 PERCEIVED_VALUE)
2. **Warm Close**: "Thank you for your time. I really enjoyed learning about the team." (+5 RAPPORT)
3. **Eager Close**: "I really hope to hear from you. This is my first choice." (-10 POWER_POSITION, FLAG: seemed_desperate)
4. **Power Close**: "I hope you make the right decision." Smile. Walk out. (Ballsy. +15 or -15 depending on how the interview went)

---

## Endings

### EXCELLENT OUTCOMES

**1. The Full Package**
**Trigger**: PERCEIVED_VALUE > 80, POWER_POSITION > 70, salary anchored high, no red flags

```
[Phone rings. Diana's number.]

DIANA: [phone]
"We'd like to offer you the position. At your number."

INNER VOICE:
You named your price. They paid it.

NARRATION:
The offer is $25K above what you would have accepted.
Sign-on bonus included. Start date: your choice.

You didn't just get the job.
You got the job on your terms.

LESSON:
The interview isn't about proving yourself.
It's about making them prove they deserve you.
```

---

**2. The Strong Offer**
**Trigger**: PERCEIVED_VALUE > 70, negotiated well

```
[Email notification]

"We're pleased to extend an offer..."

NARRATION:
They came up $15K from their first number.
Not your maximum ask, but solid.

You have leverage for the next negotiation:
the annual review.

LESSON:
Every negotiation sets the floor for the next one.
You just raised your floor.
```

---

### GOOD OUTCOMES

**3. The Offer**
**Trigger**: PERCEIVED_VALUE > 60, fewer than 3 RED_FLAGS

```
NARRATION:
You got the offer. At their original number.

Not a win. Not a loss.
You could have pushed harder.

But you're in. That's what matters.

LESSON:
The interview is just the beginning.
The real negotiation happens once you've proven yourself.
```

---

### NEUTRAL OUTCOMES

**4. The Waitlist**
**Trigger**: PERCEIVED_VALUE 50-60, mixed performance

```
[Email notification]

"Thank you for your time. We've decided to move forward
with another candidate for this role. However, we were
impressed with your background and would like to keep you
in mind for future opportunities."

INNER VOICE:
Second place. The first loser.

NARRATION:
You made the final round. But someone else made a
stronger impression.

LESSON:
Close doesn't count. Next time, anchor earlier.
Dominate the hostile moments. Leave nothing to chance.
```

---

### BAD OUTCOMES

**5. The Rejection**
**Trigger**: RED_FLAGS > 3, or PERCEIVED_VALUE < 40

```
[Form email]

"Thank you for taking the time to interview with us.
After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward
with other candidates whose experience more closely aligns..."

NARRATION:
You know what you did. The fumbled answers.
The weak handshake. The moment you seemed desperate.

LESSON:
Every interview is a performance. You only get one take.
Practice until the performance becomes natural.
```

---

**6. The Lowball Acceptance**
**Trigger**: Accepted first offer without negotiating

```
NARRATION:
You got the job.
At $35K less than you could have gotten.

In year one, you'll leave $35K on the table.
By year five, with raises building on that base?
You've lost six figures.

All because you didn't ask.

LESSON:
Silence after stating your number is the most
powerful negotiation tool. You didn't use it.
```

---

**7. The Overplay**
**Trigger**: POWER_POSITION too aggressive, Diana didn't like you

```
[Phone silence. Then, a form email.]

NARRATION:
You pushed too hard. Asked for too much.
Made them feel like they were being played.

There's a line between confidence and arrogance.
You crossed it.

LESSON:
Read the room. Power moves only work when
you've earned the position to make them.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backgrounds Needed
- office-lobby (waiting room)
- meeting-room (interview space)
- text-screen (Rachel intel, offer emails)

### Character Assets
```typescript
characterTemplates: {
  victoria: ['Victoria', 'Vanessa', 'Vivian'],
  marcus: ['Marcus', 'Michael', 'Mitchell'],
  diana: ['Diana', 'Deborah', 'Danielle'],
  james: ['James', 'Jason', 'Jordan'],
  rachel: ['Rachel', 'Riley', 'Robin']
}
```

### Stat Influence on Outcomes
```typescript
// Offer threshold
if (PERCEIVED_VALUE >= 60 && RED_FLAGS < 3) → offer
if (PERCEIVED_VALUE >= 80 && POWER_POSITION >= 70) → excellent offer

// Salary outcome
final_salary = base_offer + (POWER_POSITION * multiplier)
if (salary_anchored_high) → salary += 15%
if (competing_offer_mentioned && credible) → salary += 10%
if (accepted_first_offer) → salary -= 15%
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Power move
"Based on my experience and what I'm seeing in the market..."

// Deflection
"That's a great question. Before I answer, can you tell me..."

// Anchor
"To make this work, I'd need $X."
[SILENCE - do not fill]

// Close
"I'm looking forward to it."
[End. Don't oversell.]
```

## Inner Voice Style Guide

### During Questions
```
'This is not about the answer. It's about how you answer.'
'She's testing if you'll crack. Don't.'
'He wants you to ramble. Keep it tight.'
```

### During Reads
```
'Watch the body language. She leaned back. Skeptical?'
'He's nodding. Good sign or just polite?'
'Poker face. Don't try to read her. Just execute.'
```

### During Negotiations
```
'They made an offer. That means they want you. Use it.'
'The first person to speak after a number loses.'
'You're not begging. You're evaluating if THEY deserve YOU.'
```

## Teaching Moments Summary

1. **First impressions are made in 30 seconds** - nail the handshake, eye contact, energy
2. **The "weakness" question is a trap** - use strategic vulnerability
3. **Never give the first salary number if you can avoid it** - but if you must, anchor HIGH
4. **Behavioral questions need STAR format** - Situation, Task, Action, Result
5. **Hostile questions are tests** - don't get defensive, flip them
6. **Your questions reveal your priorities** - ask about challenges, not vacation
7. **Silence after stating your number is power** - let THEM fill the void
8. **The interview starts in the waiting room** - receptionists report back
9. **Competing offers are leverage** - even implied ones
