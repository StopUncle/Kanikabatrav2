# The Crisis

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: VIP
- **Difficulty**: Expert
- **Estimated Scenes**: 30-38
- **Category**: Crisis management, narrative control, reputation defense

---

## Logline

6 AM. Your phone explodes. A major news outlet is running a story in two hours—alleging your division falsified safety data. The accusations are partially true, more false, and entirely career-ending. You have 120 minutes to respond, and everyone—the board, the press, your enemies inside the company—is watching to see who survives this. Welcome to crisis management, where the first narrative wins.

---

## Core Theme

**In crisis, the first narrative wins.** This scenario teaches:
- Crisis communications under extreme time pressure
- Narrative control and framing
- Protecting yourself when the organization seeks scapegoats
- Board and executive management during scandals
- When to fight, when to cooperate, when to run

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Crisis Reality
Crises don't just threaten companies—they end careers. Understanding:
1. Organizations protect themselves, not individuals
2. The first story told often becomes the truth
3. Lawyers and PR serve the company, not you
4. Internal enemies use crises as weapons
5. Documentation is the only defense that survives

### The Crisis Timeline

| Phase | Duration | What's Happening | Your Priority |
|-------|----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Golden Hour** | 0-60 min | Story breaking, chaos | Assess, document, position |
| **Initial Response** | 1-4 hours | First statements made | Control your narrative |
| **Blame Phase** | 4-24 hours | Organization seeks scapegoat | Protect yourself |
| **Investigation** | 1-7 days | Facts emerge | Documentation critical |
| **Resolution** | 1-4 weeks | Accountability determined | Outcome locks in |

### Professional vs Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional | Dark Arts |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Initial response | Full transparency, accountability | Strategic disclosure, narrative control |
| Documentation | Standard retention | Secure all evidence before it disappears |
| Blame deflection | Take appropriate responsibility | Redirect to true culprits, expose enemies |
| Legal strategy | Company counsel advice | Separate personal counsel immediately |
| Communication | Coordinated message | Strategic leaks, controlled information |

## Characters

### You (The Division Head)
You run a $500M division. A story is about to break alleging your team falsified safety data. You didn't know, you didn't order it, but it happened on your watch. In 120 minutes, you need to decide: fight, comply, or run.

### Victor Sterling - CEO
**Role**: Runs the company. Will protect it first, you second.
**Style**: Strategic, sometimes ruthless about sacrifice.

**Voice Example**:
> "I need to know what you knew and when.
> And I need to know now—before the board does."

---

### Victoria Chen - General Counsel
**Role**: Company lawyer. Serves the company, not you.
**Style**: Careful, protective—of the organization.

**Voice Example**:
> "Everything you say is potentially discoverable.
> I'd advise being very precise about what you 'recall.'"

---

### Marcus Webb - Board Chair
**Role**: Represents shareholders. Will demand accountability.
**Style**: Cold, fiduciary-focused.

**Voice Example**:
> "Someone is responsible for this.
> The board will expect a clear answer."

---

### Elena Rodriguez - COO (Your Rival)
**Role**: Has wanted your job for years. Smells blood.
**Style**: Outwardly supportive, privately maneuvering.

**Voice Example**:
> "This is terrible for you. Let me know how I can help.
> I've already briefed the board on operational continuity."

---

### James Park - Reporter
**Role**: Breaking the story. Has sources inside.
**Style**: Aggressive but fair. Looking for the truth—and the drama.

**Voice Example**:
> "I'm running this story at 8 AM.
> Your comment can be part of it, or not."

---

### Sarah Chen - Your Direct Report
**Role**: The person who actually did it. Or didn't. Unclear.
**Style**: Scared, protective, potentially a liability.

**Voice Example**:
> "I followed the process we were given.
> If there are problems, they didn't start with me."

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: THE GOLDEN HOUR

#### Scene 1: 6:02 AM
**Location**: home (bedroom)

```
[Your phone hasn't stopped buzzing]

MESSAGE 1 [UNKNOWN NUMBER]:
"This is James Park from the Tribune.
Story runs at 8 AM. Call me."

MESSAGE 2 [VICTORIA CHEN - LEGAL]:
"Call me immediately. Do not talk to anyone."

MESSAGE 3 [ELENA RODRIGUEZ]:
"I just got a call from a reporter asking about your division.
What's happening?"

INNER VOICE:
Something bad.
Something very bad.

NARRATION:
You have 118 minutes before a story breaks.
What you do in the next hour determines everything.
```

---

#### Scene 2: Understanding the Threat
**Location**: home (phone call)

```
[You call Victoria Chen - General Counsel]

VICTORIA:
"A reporter contacted us.
They're alleging your division falsified Q3 safety data.
They have documents."

[pause]

VICTORIA:
"They have emails, apparently.
From someone in your team."

INNER VOICE:
Emails. Documents. This isn't rumor.

VICTORIA:
"I need to know what you know.
And I need to know now."

NARRATION:
What DO you know?
```

**Choice 1 - SETS YOUR POSITION**:
1. **Full disclosure**: "I didn't know about any falsification, but let me tell you what I do know." (+20 BOARD_CONFIDENCE, -10 LEGAL_EXPOSURE risk)
2. **Careful response**: "I need to review my records before I can give you a complete picture." (+15 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH)
3. **Deflection**: "If this happened, it happened below me without my knowledge." (+10 initial protection, -20 NARRATIVE_CONTROL if wrong)
4. **Silence**: "I'll need to speak with my own counsel before I can comment." (+25 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection, -30 BOARD_CONFIDENCE)

---

#### Scene 3: Securing Your Position
**Location**: home-office

```
[You have 100 minutes. You make a decision.]

INNER VOICE:
First rule of crisis: secure your evidence.
Before it can be... managed.

NARRATION:
Your email, your files, your records.
The company controls all of it.
If they decide you're the sacrifice,
evidence can disappear.

What do you do first?
```

**Choice 2 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Secure everything**: Forward key emails to personal account, document timeline. (+40 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH, +30 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection)
2. **Call a lawyer**: Retain personal counsel before speaking to anyone else. (+35 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection, uses time)
3. **Call your team**: Find out what actually happened from Sarah. (+25 NARRATIVE_CONTROL, risk they're already compromised)
4. **Head to office**: Take control, manage in person. (+15 INTERNAL_SUPPORT, -20 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH—no time to secure)

---

#### Scene 4: The Evidence
**Location**: home-office

```
[You review your records quickly]

NARRATION:
The emails exist.
Your team did modify some data.
But the context matters.

INNER VOICE:
The data was flagged as preliminary.
The changes were documented as corrections.
This wasn't fraud. This was... process.

But will that matter when the story breaks?

NARRATION:
You find one email that concerns you.
A subordinate wrote: "Boss wants these numbers cleaner."
You didn't write it.
But you didn't stop it either.
```

---

#### Scene 5: The Call to the Reporter
**Location**: home-office (phone)

```
[James Park, the reporter, 70 minutes before story runs]

JAMES:
"Thanks for calling back.
I'm running a story about data manipulation in your division.
Do you have a comment?"

[He reads allegations]

JAMES:
"Multiple sources confirm safety data was altered.
I have emails suggesting leadership pressure."

INNER VOICE:
He has something. But maybe not everything.

JAMES:
"Your statement will be included.
Or I can note that you declined to comment."
```

**Choice 3**:
1. **Prepared statement**: "These allegations are inaccurate. We stand behind our data processes." (+15 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)
2. **Contextualize**: "Any changes were documented corrections, not falsification. I can provide context." (+25 NARRATIVE_CONTROL, risks more exposure)
3. **Delay**: "I need to understand the specifics before commenting. Can you push the story?" (+10 buys time, unlikely to work)
4. **No comment**: "I'll decline to comment at this time." (+5 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection, -20 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)

---

### PART 2: THE INITIAL RESPONSE

#### Scene 6: The CEO Call
**Location**: car (driving to office)

```
[Victor Sterling - CEO - calling]

VICTOR:
"What the hell is happening."

[Not a question]

VICTOR:
"I just got a call from Marcus Webb.
The board chair.
About YOUR division.
Talk."

INNER VOICE:
Victor's not asking if you're okay.
He's asking how bad this is for HIM.

VICTOR:
"I need to know: are you the problem,
or are you going to fix the problem?"
```

**Choice 4 - KEY MOMENT**:
1. **Take ownership**: "This happened on my watch. I'm going to fix it and tell you how." (+25 BOARD_CONFIDENCE, +20 INTERNAL_SUPPORT)
2. **Distance yourself**: "I just learned about this. I'm investigating who's responsible." (+15 protects you, -20 looks like blame-shifting)
3. **Context and defense**: "The story is misleading. The changes were documented corrections, not fraud." (+20 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)
4. **Request support**: "I need the company behind me on this. Are you?" (+10 tests loyalty, risky)

---

#### Scene 7: The Legal Briefing
**Location**: conference-room (company legal)

```
[Victoria Chen with company counsel team]

VICTORIA:
"Let me be clear about my role.
I represent the company.
Not you personally."

[She slides a document across]

VICTORIA:
"This is a document preservation notice.
You cannot delete, alter, or move any files.
Do you understand?"

INNER VOICE:
Too late.
Or not.

VICTORIA:
"We're going to prepare a company statement.
Your personal statement, if any,
should be coordinated with us."
```

**Choice 5**:
1. "I've already secured my records for the investigation." (truth if you did +20 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH)
2. "Understood. I want the company protected." (+10 BOARD_CONFIDENCE, signals cooperation)
3. "I'll want my own counsel to review anything before I sign." (+15 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection, -10 seen as uncooperative)
4. "Who else have you spoken to about this?" (+10 gathers intel)

---

#### Scene 8: The Enemy Emerges
**Location**: hallway

```
[Elena Rodriguez intercepts you]

ELENA:
"This is terrible.
How can I help?"

[Her face says concern.
Her eyes say something else.]

ELENA:
"I've already briefed the board on continuity.
Just in case they need to understand
how operations could continue without disruption."

INNER VOICE:
She's moving.
While you're defending, she's positioning.

ELENA:
"I told them you have my full support, of course."
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **Direct confrontation**: "Let me be clear: I know what you're doing." (+15 confronts threat, -10 creates enemy)
2. **Strategic acknowledgment**: "Thanks, Elena. I'll remember your support." (+10 notes the threat, bides time)
3. **Redirect**: "The focus should be on facts, not organizational charts." (+15 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)
4. **Ignore**: "I have to prepare for the board." (+5 dismissive, she continues maneuvering)

---

#### Scene 9: The Subordinate
**Location**: private-office

```
[Sarah Chen - your direct report who's named in emails]

SARAH:
"I did what I was told to do.
I have the documentation."

[She looks scared]

SARAH:
"I followed the process we've always followed.
If that process is wrong, it's not MY fault."

INNER VOICE:
She has emails.
You're in some of them.
She can help you or hurt you.

SARAH:
"What should I tell the investigators?"

NARRATION:
What do you tell her?
```

**Choice 7 - ETHICAL CHOICE**:
1. **Honest guidance**: "Tell the truth. Exactly what happened. That's what I'm doing." (+20 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH, +15 integrity)
2. **Align stories**: "Let's review what happened together so we're consistent." (+15 NARRATIVE_CONTROL, -20 ethical compromise)
3. **Distance yourself**: "I can't advise you. You should speak to your own counsel." (+10 protects you, -15 INTERNAL_SUPPORT)
4. **Implied threat**: "Remember who approved your last two promotions." (-30 integrity, +10 short-term control, very risky)

---

### PART 3: THE BLAME PHASE

#### Scene 10: The Board Call
**Location**: conference-room (video call)

```
[Marcus Webb - Board Chair]

MARCUS:
"The company's reputation is on the line.
Someone is accountable."

[He looks directly at camera]

MARCUS:
"I'm not interested in corporate speak.
What happened, and who's responsible?"

INNER VOICE:
The board doesn't want context.
They want a name.

VICTOR: [CEO, also on call]
"We're still investigating—"

MARCUS:
"Victor. I'm asking [YOUR NAME] directly."
```

**Choice 8 - CRITICAL MOMENT**:
1. **Own it strategically**: "It happened in my division. I'm responsible for fixing it and for any process failures that allowed it." (+30 BOARD_CONFIDENCE, +20 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)
2. **Redirect to facts**: "I can tell you what our investigation shows so far. The full picture is more complex than the article suggests." (+25 NARRATIVE_CONTROL)
3. **Name someone**: "Sarah Chen made the specific decisions. I was not informed." (+20 protects you, -40 INTERNAL_SUPPORT, -30 integrity)
4. **Expose the enemy**: "I'm concerned about who leaked this and why. Elena Rodriguez briefed you before I could." (+15 redirects blame, risky)

---

#### Scene 11: The Investigation
**Location**: conference-room (day 2)

```
[External investigators are now involved]

INVESTIGATOR:
"We've reviewed the emails.
Your name appears in discussions about 'optimizing' the data."

[They slide a document across]

INVESTIGATOR:
"Did you instruct your team to modify the safety figures?"

INNER VOICE:
This is the moment.
What you say here determines everything.

INVESTIGATOR:
"I'll remind you—this is under oath."
```

**Choice 9**:
1. **Truth with context**: "I asked for data review. 'Optimizing' meant accuracy, not manipulation." (+25 DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH if you have evidence)
2. **Deny knowledge**: "I never instructed anyone to falsify anything." (+15 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection if true)
3. **Invoke counsel**: "I'd like to consult with my attorney before answering." (+30 LEGAL_EXPOSURE protection, -20 BOARD_CONFIDENCE)
4. **Accept responsibility**: "I may have created pressure that was misinterpreted. That's my failure." (+20 BOARD_CONFIDENCE, -15 LEGAL_EXPOSURE risk)

---

#### Scene 12: The Offer
**Location**: victor-office

```
[Victor, privately, day 3]

VICTOR:
"The board wants resolution.
Fast."

[He doesn't look at you]

VICTOR:
"I can protect you somewhat.
But I need something in return."

[pause]

VICTOR:
"If you resign, we'll characterize it as mutual.
No lawsuit, no investigation into your role.
Full severance."

INNER VOICE:
He's offering you an exit.
A golden parachute.
And a permanent question mark on your record.

VICTOR:
"Or we fight this out.
But I can't control where that goes."
```

**Choice 10 - FINAL DECISION**:
1. **Accept the exit**: "I'll resign. Protect my reputation in the announcement." (→ Controlled exit ending)
2. **Negotiate harder**: "I want 24 months severance and a letter stating I was not responsible." (+20 pushes for better terms)
3. **Refuse**: "I'm not resigning for something I didn't do. I'll fight." (+40 NARRATIVE_CONTROL, all-or-nothing)
4. **Expose the truth**: "Elena's fingerprints are all over the leak. Let's talk about that first." (+25 redirects, risky)

---

## Endings

### SURVIVED

**1. Vindicated**
**Trigger**: High DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH, NARRATIVE_CONTROL, investigation clears you

```
NARRATION:
The investigation concludes.
The data changes were documented corrections.
The process was flawed, not the intent.

You keep your job.
Elena's maneuvering is noted, if not punished.

INNER VOICE:
You won.
But the scars remain.
Trust is harder now.

LESSON:
Document everything.
The paper trail is the only truth that survives.
```

---

**2. Scarred but Standing**
**Trigger**: Moderate outcomes, kept job but damaged

```
NARRATION:
You survive.
Diminished, perhaps. Watched more closely.
But still here.

The crisis taught you:
Everyone is a threat. Everything must be documented.
Trust is a luxury you can no longer afford.

INNER VOICE:
You learned what this place really is.
And what you really are.

LESSON:
Survival isn't victory.
But it's better than the alternative.
```

---

### EXITS

**3. The Golden Parachute**
**Trigger**: Resigned with good terms

```
NARRATION:
You leave.
The severance is generous.
The announcement is neutral.

Six months later, you're running something else.
The crisis becomes a line item, not a headline.

INNER VOICE:
You didn't fight.
But you didn't lose everything either.
Sometimes leaving well is winning.

LESSON:
Know when the fight isn't worth it.
Exit with your options intact.
```

---

**4. Threw Someone Under the Bus**
**Trigger**: Blamed Sarah, saved yourself

```
NARRATION:
Sarah was fired.
You kept your job.
The board was satisfied.

But your team saw.
And they remember.

INNER VOICE:
You protected yourself.
By sacrificing someone else.
Can you live with that?

LESSON:
Some victories cost more than they're worth.
You know what you are now.
```

---

### FAILED

**5. The Scapegoat**
**Trigger**: Low DOCUMENTATION_STRENGTH, became the sacrifice

```
NARRATION:
You were fired.
"To restore stakeholder confidence."

The investigation cleared you months later.
Too late.

INNER VOICE:
You were sacrificed.
Not for what you did.
For what they needed.

LESSON:
In crisis, organizations protect themselves.
If you don't document, you can't defend.
```

---

**6. Career Destroyed**
**Trigger**: Evidence showed culpability or cover-up

```
NARRATION:
The emails were clear.
The context didn't matter.
You knew. Or you should have.

Criminal charges weren't filed.
But criminal was what people called you.

INNER VOICE:
You built something.
It's gone now.
All of it.

LESSON:
Some lines can't be uncrossed.
The cover-up is always worse than the crime.
```

---

**7. Fought and Lost**
**Trigger**: Refused to resign, lost anyway

```
NARRATION:
You fought.
The board voted.
You lost.

Fired for cause.
No severance.
Public humiliation.

INNER VOICE:
You chose to fight.
You were right to fight.
You still lost.

LESSON:
Sometimes the fight is unwinnable.
Knowing when is wisdom.
Refusing to accept it is pride.
```

---

## Technical Notes

### Crisis Timeline Mechanics
```typescript
crisisPhases = {
  golden_hour: { duration: '0-60min', priority: 'secure_position' },
  initial_response: { duration: '1-4hrs', priority: 'control_narrative' },
  blame_phase: { duration: '4-72hrs', priority: 'survive_scapegoating' },
  investigation: { duration: '1-7days', priority: 'documentation' },
  resolution: { duration: '1-4weeks', priority: 'outcome' }
}
```

### Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Taking ownership
"This happened on my watch. I'm going to fix it."

// Creating distance
"I just learned about this. I'm investigating."

// Securing position
"I need to speak with my own counsel first."

// Exposing enemies
"I'm concerned about who leaked this and why."
```

### Inner Voice Style
- Urgent: "118 minutes. Every second matters."
- Cynical: "The company protects itself. Not you. Remember that."
- Strategic: "Evidence that doesn't exist can't be used against you."
