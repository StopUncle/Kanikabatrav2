---

## Logline

Fifteen minutes. The board room. The C-suite watching. One chance to prove you belong at the next level. Your slides are ready. Your data is solid. But slides and data aren't what they're really evaluating. They're evaluating YOU. Your presence. Your command. Your ability to hold a room full of powerful people. This presentation will either accelerate your career—or stall it for years.

---

## Core Theme

**High-stakes presentations aren't about content—they're about command.** This scenario teaches:
- Executive presence: what it is and how to project it
- Handling hostile questions without losing composure
- The difference between presenting to peers vs. presenting to power
- Reading the room and adjusting in real-time
- Recovering from mistakes under pressure

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Executive Presence Test
Leadership evaluates presenters on three dimensions:
1. **Gravitas**: Do they seem like they belong at this level?
2. **Command**: Can they control a room?
3. **Composure**: What happens when challenged?

Your content could be perfect. If you don't project these qualities, you've failed.

### Key Frameworks

**1. The First 30 Seconds**
Executives form impressions immediately. Your opening—how you walk in, where you stand, your first words—sets everything.

**2. The Power Stance**
Body language communicates before you speak. Centered, grounded, taking space vs. shrinking, fidgeting, apologizing.

**3. Hostile Questions Are Tests**
When a C-level challenges you, they're rarely asking for information. They're testing your composure. HOW you respond matters more than WHAT you say.

**4. The Recovery**
Everyone stumbles. Not everyone recovers. The ability to acknowledge a miss and keep moving is more valuable than never missing.

**5. Less Is More**
Executives don't want every detail. They want the insight, the recommendation, the risk. Brevity signals confidence.

### Professional vs. Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional Approach | Dark Arts Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Opening | Confident, clear, purpose-driven | Power stance, slight pause, make them wait for you |
| Hostile question | Acknowledge, answer directly, pivot | Mirror the energy back, don't let them dominate |
| Mistake | Acknowledge briefly, continue confidently | Reframe it as intentional, move on without admission |
| Silence | Pause to think, then answer | Use silence as power—they'll fill it if you wait |
| Close | Clear recommendation, invite questions | Make them feel like they're losing something if they don't act |

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: BEFORE YOU ENTER

#### Scene 1: The Night Before
**Location**: apartment

```
NARRATION:
Tomorrow. 2 PM. Board room.

[You're reviewing slides. Again.]

INNER VOICE:
You've practiced this twenty times.
You know the content cold.

But knowing the content isn't what this is about.

[You catch your reflection in the window]

INNER VOICE:
Tomorrow, they're not evaluating your slides.
They're evaluating YOU.

Do you project authority?
Do you handle pressure?
Do you seem like you belong at their level?

That's the real test.
```

---

#### Scene 2: Chen's Advice
**Location**: office (morning of)

```
[Chen pulls you aside]

CHEN:
"You ready?"

YOU:
"I think so."

CHEN:
"Let me give you some advice.
These people don't need more data.
They need someone who can distill data into insight."

[pause]

CHEN:
"Less is more. Cut 30% of your slides.
Say less. Mean more.

And when Victoria asks a question—
she's not asking for information.
She's testing you.

Answer like someone who belongs in that room.
Because today, you need to prove you do."
```

**Choice 1**:
1. "Got it. Focus on insights, not data." (+10 CLARITY)
2. "What if I don't know an answer?" (+10 COMPOSURE prep)
3. "Any specific landmines I should know about?" (+10 INTEL)
4. "Thanks. I'm just going to be myself." (Neutral, but risky)

---

#### Scene 3: The Anxiety
**Location**: office (bathroom mirror)

```
[Five minutes before. You're looking in the mirror.]

INNER VOICE:
Breathe.

[Your heart is pounding]

INNER VOICE:
This is adrenaline. It's supposed to happen.
The question is what you do with it.

You can let it make you faster, sharper, more present.
Or you can let it make you scattered, nervous, small.

[You take a breath. Ground yourself.]

INNER VOICE:
You know the content.
You've done hard things before.
The only difference is the audience.

And the stakes.
```

---

#### Scene 4: The Walk
**Location**: office-hallway

```
[Walking to the board room]

INNER VOICE:
Last chance to set your mental state.

How do you want to walk into that room?

NARRATION:
Body language starts before you speak.
Your posture, your pace, your energy—
they'll read all of it.
```

**Choice 2**:
1. **Power stance mentality**: Shoulders back, pace steady, take up space (+15 PRESENCE)
2. **Calm and collected**: Breathe, center yourself, project quiet confidence (+10 PRESENCE, +10 COMPOSURE)
3. **Review notes one more time**: Glance at key points on your phone (Neutral, might seem underprepared)
4. **Just get through this**: Survival mode (-10 PRESENCE)

---

### PART 2: THE PRESENTATION

#### Scene 5: The Entrance
**Location**: meeting-room (board room)

```
[You enter. Four faces turn toward you.]

[Victoria - CEO - at the head. Poker face.]
[Marcus - CFO - reviewing a document.]
[Elena - COO - checking email on phone.]
[Chen - Your champion - gives a subtle nod.]

VICTORIA: [neutral]
"We're ready when you are."

INNER VOICE:
This is it.
The first 30 seconds set everything.

NARRATION:
How do you open?
```

**Choice 3 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Power opening**: Pause. Make eye contact. "I'm here to show you how we capture $20M in the next 18 months." (+20 PRESENCE, +15 CLARITY)
2. **Confident but humble**: "Thank you for the time. I know it's valuable. Here's what I want to share." (+10 PRESENCE, +10 CREDIBILITY)
3. **Jump to content**: "Let me share my screen and walk you through the deck." (-10 PRESENCE, functional but forgettable)
4. **Nervous opening**: "Thanks for having me. I hope this is useful. Let me just..." (-20 PRESENCE, signals uncertainty)

---

#### Scene 6: Reading the Room
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Five minutes in. You're presenting.]

INNER VOICE:
Scan the room. What are you seeing?

[Victoria - still poker face. Slight nod once. Good sign?]
[Marcus - frowning at a slide. Bad sign.]
[Elena - put down her phone. Now listening.]
[Chen - neutral. Won't help publicly.]

INNER VOICE:
Marcus is skeptical. Address it before he asks.
Elena is engaged. Keep her there.
Victoria is unreadable. You'll know when she speaks.

NARRATION:
Do you adjust your approach?
```

**Choice 4**:
1. **Preemptive addressing**: "I can see some concern about the numbers. Let me address that directly." (+15 CREDIBILITY, shows awareness)
2. **Stay the course**: Keep presenting as planned (Neutral)
3. **Speed up**: Get to the recommendation before they interrupt (-10 COMPOSURE, looks rushed)
4. **Ask for input**: "Marcus, I see you reviewing the projections. Any immediate concerns?" (Risky: +20 or -10 depending on his response)

---

#### Scene 7: The CFO Challenge
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Marcus interrupts]

MARCUS:
"Stop there."

[You stop]

MARCUS:
"Your projections assume 15% growth.
In this market, with these headwinds—
walk me through why that's not wishful thinking."

INNER VOICE:
The first hostile question.
Not about information. About composure.

NARRATION:
How do you respond?
```

**Choice 5 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Confident direct answer**: "Fair question. Here's the evidence: [specific data points]. I'm happy to defend each assumption." (+20 CREDIBILITY, +15 COMPOSURE, FLAG: handled_hostile_well)
2. **Acknowledge and pivot**: "It's aggressive. Here's why I think it's achievable, and here's the downside scenario if we miss." (+15 CREDIBILITY, +10 COMPOSURE)
3. **Defensive**: "The methodology is standard. I can walk you through it..." (-10 COMPOSURE, sounds uncertain)
4. **Defer**: "I'd be happy to follow up with the details after." (-20 CREDIBILITY, looks underprepared)

---

#### Scene 8: The COO Challenge
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Elena leans forward]

ELENA:
"I've seen a lot of great strategies fail in execution.
How does this actually get done?
Who does the work? What's the timeline?"

INNER VOICE:
Execution question. She doesn't trust vision without action.

Give her concrete. Give her realistic.

NARRATION:
Your response?
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **Concrete plan**: "Phase one: [specific]. Phase two: [specific]. Resources required: [specific]." (+15 CREDIBILITY, +10 CLARITY)
2. **Framework answer**: "I've built an implementation framework that addresses resourcing, milestones, and dependencies." (+10 CREDIBILITY)
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: "I have the high-level plan. The details would need to be worked out with ops." (-5 CREDIBILITY, honest but not what she wants)
4. **Overpromise**: "We can have this running in 60 days." (-15 CREDIBILITY, she knows that's unrealistic)

---

#### Scene 9: The Stumble
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Victoria speaks for the first time]

VICTORIA:
"What about competitive response?
If this works, what do they do?
And what do we do when they do it?"

[The question catches you off guard. You didn't prep for this angle.]

INNER VOICE:
You don't have a good answer.
What do you do?

NARRATION:
This is the moment.
Everyone stumbles. Not everyone recovers.
```

**Choice 7 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Honest acknowledgment + thinking out loud**: "I don't have that fully mapped. Here's my initial thinking... [genuine answer]. I'd want to develop that further." (+20 COMPOSURE, +10 CREDIBILITY, FLAG: stumbled_recovered)
2. **Buy time with reframe**: "That's a critical question. The scenarios I'd consider are... [give framework]." (+15 COMPOSURE, +10 CREDIBILITY)
3. **Bluff through it**: Make up an answer that sounds confident (-20 CREDIBILITY if they catch it)
4. **Freeze and apologize**: "I... I'm not sure. Let me get back to you." (-20 COMPOSURE, -15 PRESENCE, FLAG: stumbled_failed)

---

#### Scene 10: The Close
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Fourteen minutes. Time to close.]

INNER VOICE:
The close matters.
Weak close erases strong presentation.
Strong close covers minor stumbles.

NARRATION:
How do you finish?
```

**Choice 8**:
1. **Clear recommendation**: "My recommendation is X. Here's why. I'm asking for Y to proceed." (+20 CLARITY, +15 PRESENCE, FLAG: crisp_close)
2. **Summarize and invite**: "In summary: [three points]. I'd value your direction on next steps." (+15 CLARITY, +10 PRESENCE)
3. **Open-ended**: "So that's the proposal. Happy to answer any other questions." (+5 CLARITY)
4. **Fizzle**: "That's... basically it. Let me know what you think." (-15 PRESENCE, FLAG: mumbled_close)

---

### PART 3: THE AFTERMATH

#### Scene 11: The Room Empties
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[They thank you. Start to leave. Victoria pauses at the door.]

VICTORIA: [to you, direct]
"Good work."

[Two words. She leaves.]

INNER VOICE:
'Good work.'
From Victoria, that's a lot.

[Or if stumbled:]
[Victoria says nothing. Nods. Leaves.]

INNER VOICE:
No feedback. Not a good sign.
Or just her style? Hard to tell.
```

---

#### Scene 12: Chen's Debrief
**Location**: office-hallway

```
[Chen catches you after]

CHEN: [varies by performance]

[If strong:]
"That was really good. Marcus was testing you, and you held.
Victoria doesn't say 'good work' often."

[If mixed:]
"You had some strong moments. The competitive response question—
that was rough. But you recovered okay.
They're still considering."

[If weak:]
"I'm going to be honest. It didn't land.
Marcus didn't buy the numbers. Victoria went quiet.
We need to think about damage control."
```

---

## Endings

### EXCELLENT OUTCOMES

**1. The Star Turn**
**Trigger**: PRESENCE > 85, handled_hostile_well, crisp_close

```
[Email from Victoria, two days later]

"I was impressed with your presentation.
Let's schedule time to discuss your role
in leading this initiative—and your career trajectory."

INNER VOICE:
Fifteen minutes changed everything.
You walked in as a manager.
You walked out as a future executive.

LESSON:
At this level, content is expected.
Presence is the differentiator.
You showed both.
```

---

**2. The Breakthrough**
**Trigger**: PRESENCE > 70, stumbled_recovered, impressed_ceo

```
NARRATION:
The project got approved.
More importantly, YOU got noticed.

CHEN:
"Victoria asked me about your potential.
I told her you're ready for more."

INNER VOICE:
The stumble might have helped.
It showed you could handle pressure.
Anyone can present when everything goes right.
Not everyone can recover.

LESSON:
How you handle the unexpected
matters more than how you handle the expected.
```

---

### GOOD OUTCOMES

**3. The Solid Performance**
**Trigger**: PRESENCE 50-70, no major stumbles, good close

```
NARRATION:
The presentation landed. Not spectacularly.
But professionally.

CHEN:
"They're moving forward. You did your job.
Not flashy, but effective."

INNER VOICE:
You didn't change your career.
But you didn't hurt it either.
Another chance will come.

LESSON:
Not every presentation is a breakthrough moment.
Some are just building blocks.
```

---

### NEGATIVE OUTCOMES

**4. The Missed Opportunity**
**Trigger**: stumbled_failed, mumbled_close, PRESENCE < 50

```
NARRATION:
The project is on hold.
Officially, it's about "timing and priorities."
Unofficially, it's about you.

CHEN: [honest]
"I'm going to level with you.
The Victoria question sunk you.
You had a chance to show composure, and instead..."

[pause]

CHEN:
"You'll get another shot. But not soon."

LESSON:
Fifteen minutes can close doors as fast as open them.
Preparation includes the questions you don't expect.
```

---

**5. The Credibility Hit**
**Trigger**: Lost CFO on numbers, CREDIBILITY < 40

```
[Word gets back to you]

COLLEAGUE:
"Marcus told his team the projections were 'optimistic at best.'
That's not great for future proposals."

INNER VOICE:
The CFO doesn't trust your numbers.
That sticks. That follows you.

LESSON:
Executives talk to each other.
A credibility hit in one room
spreads to every room.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Presence Calculation
```typescript
// Key moments affect presence score
if (power_opening) PRESENCE += 20
if (handled_hostile_well) PRESENCE += 15
if (stumbled_recovered) PRESENCE += 10
if (stumbled_failed) PRESENCE -= 20
if (crisp_close) PRESENCE += 15
if (mumbled_close) PRESENCE -= 15
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Power opening
"I'm here to show you how we capture $20M in the next 18 months."

// Handling hostile question
"Fair question. Here's the evidence: [specific data points]."

// Acknowledging uncertainty
"I don't have that fully mapped. Here's my initial thinking..."

// Strong close
"My recommendation is X. Here's why. I'm asking for Y to proceed."
```

---

## Inner Voice Style Guide

### Preparation
```
'Tomorrow, they're not evaluating your slides. They're evaluating YOU.'
'Less is more. Cut 30% of your slides. Say less. Mean more.'
'The only difference is the audience. And the stakes.'
```

### During Presentation
```
'The first hostile question. Not about information. About composure.'
'Everyone stumbles. Not everyone recovers.'
'The close matters. Weak close erases strong presentation.'
```

### After
```
'Fifteen minutes changed everything.'
'How you handle the unexpected matters more than the expected.'
'A credibility hit in one room spreads to every room.'
```
