# The Raise Negotiation

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: Premium
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate to Advanced
- **Estimated Scenes**: 24-30
- **Category**: Compensation negotiation, leverage building, power dynamics

---

## Logline

You've been here two years. You've outperformed your peers. You've made the company money. And you're still paid like someone who just walked in the door. Today, that changes. But getting what you deserve isn't about asking nicely—it's about making them terrified to lose you.

---

## Core Theme

**A raise is not a reward—it's a negotiation.** This scenario teaches:
- Why waiting to be recognized is a losing strategy
- How to build leverage BEFORE you ask
- The psychology of anchoring and BATNA
- When to use competing offers (real or implied)
- The dark arts of making yourself indispensable
- How to handle rejection and counteroffer

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Fundamental Truth
Companies pay the minimum they can to retain you. Your salary isn't based on your value—it's based on your leverage. If you have no leverage, you have no raise.

### Key Frameworks

**1. BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)**
Your power comes from your ability to walk away. No alternative = no power. Build your BATNA before you need it.

**2. Anchoring**
The first number spoken sets the range. If your manager says "We're thinking 3%," you've already lost. Anchor first, anchor high.

**3. The Scarcity Play**
You're not asking for a favor—you're informing them of market reality. "I'm being recruited" changes everything.

**4. Strategic Timing**
- After a big win = leverage
- Before annual reviews = too late
- After you've saved a project = perfect
- When you're frustrated = worst time

**5. The Indispensability Trap**
Make yourself essential, but not so essential you can't be promoted. The goal: they can't lose you, but they can elevate you.

### Professional vs. Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional Approach | Dark Arts Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Building the case | Document achievements with metrics | Make sure key people know about your wins |
| Timing | After strong performance review | After rescuing a failing project |
| The ask | Research-based range + value demonstration | Competing offer (real or strategically implied) |
| Handling "no budget" | Ask about timeline/alternatives | Suggest they'll find budget when you leave |
| Manager resistance | Understand constraints, find creative solutions | Go above them if they won't advocate |

## Characters

### You (The Underpaid Performer)
Two years in. Consistently exceeds expectations. Paid 15-20% below market. Time to fix that.

### Derek/Dana - Your Manager
**Role**: First gatekeeper. May or may not have authority to approve raises.
**Variables**: Supportive but constrained? Threatened by your success? Checked out?

**Types** (scenario adapts based on early reads):

**Supportive Derek/Dana**:
> "Look, I've been pushing for this. Let me see what I can do."

**Threatened Derek/Dana**:
> "You're doing fine. Let's not rock the boat."

**Checked-Out Derek/Dana**:
> "I'll have to check with HR on that. Send me an email."

---

### Marcus - VP (Derek's Boss)
**Role**: The real decision maker. Going to him is a power play—risky but sometimes necessary.

**Voice Example**:
> "Derek mentioned you wanted to discuss compensation. I appreciate you bringing this to me directly."

---

### Priya - HR Partner
**Role**: Either gatekeeper or ally, depending on how you approach her.

**Voice Example**:
> "We try to keep raises within 3-5% for retention. Anything more requires special approval."

---

### Jordan - The Recruiter (Phone/Text)
**Role**: Your BATNA. Real opportunity or strategic leverage.

**Voice Example**:
> "Based on your background, the role is paying $X-$Y. They're moving fast. Can you talk this week?"

---

### Sam - Trusted Colleague
**Role**: Intel gatherer. Knows what others are making. Reality check.

**Voice Example**:
> "Between us? They hired the new person at $15K more than you. Same role. Less experience."

---

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: BUILDING THE CASE

#### Scene 1: The Realization
**Location**: office (or coffee-shop)

```
[Lunch with Sam. Casual, then not.]

SAM: [lowered voice]
"So you know they hired that new PM, right?
Taylor? Same level as you?"

YOU:
"Yeah. Seems fine."

SAM:
"You know what they're paying them?"

[Sam looks around, leans in]

SAM: [concerned]
"$95K. Starting."

INNER VOICE:
You've been here two years. You're at $82K.
A newcomer just walked in at $13K more than you.

[Your expression doesn't change. Inside, you're doing math.]

SAM:
"Same role. Less experience. Welcome to corporate compensation."

INNER VOICE:
This isn't about fairness. It's about leverage.
And right now, you have none.

Time to build some.
```

---

#### Scene 2: The Documentation
**Location**: apartment (late night, your laptop)

```
NARRATION:
Step one: build the case. Ammunition.

[Your screen shows a document in progress:
"Contributions & Impact - [Your Name]"]

INNER VOICE:
Every project saved. Every fire put out.
Every dollar made or saved.

Numbers. Specifics. Not feelings.

[You start typing]

NARRATION:
Q2: Rescued the Hendricks account when they were about to churn.
Value retained: $400K annually.

Q3: Led the system migration that came in under budget.
Savings: $85K.

Q4: Trained three new team members without dropping
your own deliverables.

INNER VOICE:
This isn't bragging. This is evidence.
```

**Choice 1**:
1. Document thoroughly - every win with numbers (+20 CASE_STRENGTH, FLAG: documented_wins)
2. Quick bullet points - enough to reference (+10 CASE_STRENGTH)
3. Skip this - your work speaks for itself (-10 CASE_STRENGTH, "Your work doesn't speak. You speak for your work.")
4. Ask Sam to vouch for you (+5 CASE_STRENGTH, +10 ESCALATION_RISK if manager finds out)

---

#### Scene 3: Market Research
**Location**: apartment (laptop)

```
NARRATION:
Step two: know your market value.

[Browser shows salary comparison sites]

INNER VOICE:
Glassdoor says your role pays $88-$102K in this market.
LinkedIn shows similar roles posted at $95K+.
You're at $82K.

You're not asking for a raise.
You're correcting a market discrepancy.

[You screenshot everything]

INNER VOICE:
Data. Not emotions.
"I feel underpaid" gets you nothing.
"The market says I'm underpaid" gets you a conversation.
```

**Choice 2**:
1. Compile comprehensive market data (+15 CASE_STRENGTH, +10 LEVERAGE, FLAG: market_research_done)
2. Check a few sites, get a general range (+10 CASE_STRENGTH)
3. Skip - you know you're underpaid (-5 LEVERAGE, "Knowing isn't proving")

---

#### Scene 4: Building the BATNA
**Location**: text-screen

```
[LinkedIn notification: "A recruiter wants to connect"]

INNER VOICE:
Step three: alternatives.

You don't need to leave. But you need to be ABLE to leave.
That's the difference between asking and negotiating.

[You accept the connection. Message appears:]

JORDAN: [recruiter]
"Hi [Name], I came across your profile and think
you'd be a great fit for a Senior PM role at [Company].
The range is $95-110K. Would you be open to a quick call?"

INNER VOICE:
$95-110K. You're at $82K.

Do you engage?
```

**Choice 3**:
1. Take the call - real BATNA is strongest (+25 BATNA_QUALITY, FLAG: competing_offer_real path)
2. Polite interest - keep them warm but don't commit (+15 BATNA_QUALITY)
3. Decline - you want to stay here (-10 BATNA_QUALITY, "Loyalty without leverage is exploitation")
4. Use this as leverage without actually engaging (+10 BATNA_QUALITY, +10 ESCALATION_RISK - can backfire if bluff is called)

---

#### Scene 5: Reading Your Manager
**Location**: office

```
NARRATION:
Before you ask, you need to know who you're asking.

[You observe Derek/Dana over the next few days]

INNER VOICE:
Are they supportive? Fighting for their people?
Threatened by your success?
Checked out? Just collecting a paycheck?

[You notice: Do they take credit for your work?
Do they mention you in leadership meetings?
Do they seem stressed about budget?]

NARRATION:
Which Derek/Dana are you dealing with?
```

**Choice 4 (sets manager type for rest of scenario)**:
1. They've been supportive - advocates for the team (+20 RELATIONSHIP, manager = Supportive)
2. They seem threatened - don't like you outshining them (-10 RELATIONSHIP, +20 ESCALATION_RISK, manager = Threatened)
3. They're checked out - won't fight for anything (-5 RELATIONSHIP, manager = Checked-Out)
4. You can't read them - going in blind (+10 ESCALATION_RISK)

---

### PART 2: THE ASK

#### Scene 6: Setting Up the Meeting
**Location**: office/text-screen

```
INNER VOICE:
Time to make the ask. But how you set it up matters.

"Hey, got a sec?" = they're not prepared, you're ambushing.
"Can we schedule time to discuss my compensation?" = gives them time to prepare.

The second option is professional.
The first option is tactical.

Which approach?
```

**Choice 5**:
1. Schedule formally - "I'd like to discuss my compensation. Can we find 30 minutes?" (+10 RELATIONSHIP, -5 LEVERAGE - gives them time to prepare)
2. Catch them after a win - "Hey, got a minute? There's something on my mind." (+10 LEVERAGE, -5 RELATIONSHIP if they feel ambushed)
3. Write it in email first - lay out your case in writing (+15 CASE_STRENGTH, -10 RELATIONSHIP - seems distant)
4. Wait for your annual review (too late - you're playing their game, -15 LEVERAGE)

---

#### Scene 7: The Opening
**Location**: meeting-room (or manager's office)

```
[You're in Derek/Dana's office. Door closed.]

DEREK/DANA: [neutral]
"So. You wanted to talk."

INNER VOICE:
This is it. Don't apologize. Don't ramble.
State your case. Own the room.

NARRATION:
How do you open?
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **Direct + Data**: "I want to discuss my compensation. I've been here two years, I've delivered [specific wins], and I'm currently paid 15% below market for my role." (+15 LEVERAGE, +10 CASE_STRENGTH)
2. **Relationship First**: "I really value working here and want to talk about how we can make sure my compensation reflects my contribution." (+10 RELATIONSHIP, +5 LEVERAGE)
3. **Implied Urgency**: "I've been approached by other companies. Before I even consider anything, I wanted to talk to you." (+20 LEVERAGE, -10 RELATIONSHIP if seen as threat)
4. **Soft Ask**: "I was hoping to discuss the possibility of a raise at some point..." (-15 LEVERAGE, sounds uncertain)

---

#### Scene 8: The Case Presentation
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Derek/Dana is listening. Your move.]

INNER VOICE:
Present the evidence. Not feelings. Facts.

NARRATION:
You lay out:
- Your tenure and growth
- Specific wins with dollar values
- Market data showing you're underpaid
- What you're asking for

DEREK/DANA: [processing]
"That's... comprehensive."

[They're looking at your documentation]

DEREK/DANA:
"You've clearly thought about this."

INNER VOICE:
Translation: They weren't expecting you to come armed.

Good.
```

---

#### Scene 9: The First Objection
**Location**: meeting-room

```
DEREK/DANA: [measured]
"Look, I hear you. But the budget is tight right now.
We're not really doing off-cycle raises."

INNER VOICE:
The "budget" objection. Classic.

Translation: "I don't want to fight for this."

Or: "I don't have authority and don't want to admit it."

NARRATION:
How do you respond?
```

**Choice 7**:
1. **Challenge the Budget Myth**: "I understand. But there's always budget for retention when someone leaves. I'd rather we solve this proactively." (+15 LEVERAGE)
2. **Ask About Timeline**: "When would be the right time? And what would I need to demonstrate?" (+10 RELATIONSHIP, buys time)
3. **Escalate the Stakes**: "I appreciate that. Which is why I wanted to have this conversation before I started taking calls from recruiters seriously." (+25 LEVERAGE, +20 ESCALATION_RISK)
4. **Accept the Objection**: "I understand. Maybe we can revisit at annual review." (-20 LEVERAGE, you just lost)

---

#### Scene 10: Manager Response (Varies by Type)

**If SUPPORTIVE Manager:**
```
DEREK/DANA: [genuine]
"Between us? I've been trying to get you more.
Let me take this to [VP/HR]. I'll push hard."

[pause]

DEREK/DANA:
"What number are we talking about?"

INNER VOICE:
Anchor time. First number sets the range.
```

**If THREATENED Manager:**
```
DEREK/DANA: [slight edge]
"I think you're doing fine where you are.
We're all making sacrifices."

[arms crossed]

DEREK/DANA:
"Is there something else going on here?"

INNER VOICE:
They see you as a threat. Not an asset.
This might require going around them.
```

**If CHECKED-OUT Manager:**
```
DEREK/DANA: [glancing at phone]
"Yeah, I get it. Let me send something to HR.
These things take time."

[They're already checked out of this conversation]

INNER VOICE:
They're not going to fight for you.
They're not going to fight for anything.
```

---

#### Scene 11: The Anchor
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[If manager asked for a number...]

INNER VOICE:
Anchor high. Not delusional. But high.

If market rate is $95-105K and you're at $82K,
you don't ask for $90K.

You ask for $105K.
Then you meet somewhere you're happy.

NARRATION:
What number do you say?
```

**Choice 8**:
1. **Anchor High**: "Based on my contributions and market data, I'm looking at $105K." (+20 LEVERAGE, sets ceiling high)
2. **Anchor Market**: "The market rate for my role is $95-105K. I should be at least at $95K." (+15 LEVERAGE)
3. **Anchor Low**: "I was thinking something like $88K would be fair." (-10 LEVERAGE, you just capped yourself)
4. **Let Them Anchor**: "What do you think is fair?" (-20 LEVERAGE, fatal error - they'll lowball)

---

#### Scene 12: The Counter
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[A few days later. Derek/Dana calls you in.]

DEREK/DANA:
"I talked to leadership. They approved an increase."

[pause]

DEREK/DANA:
"We can do $87K. That's a 6% bump. Strong for off-cycle."

INNER VOICE:
$87K. You asked for $105K.
Market rate is $95K.
They're still underpaying you.

6% sounds nice until you do the math.

NARRATION:
Your counter?
```

**Choice 9 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Accept Gratefully**: "Thank you, I really appreciate it." (-15 LEVERAGE, left $8K+ on table)
2. **Counter Higher**: "I appreciate the movement. To make this work, I need to be at market rate - $95K." (+20 LEVERAGE)
3. **Add Non-Salary**: "Can we discuss title change and additional PTO if the base has limits?" (+10 LEVERAGE, creative)
4. **Deploy BATNA**: "I was really hoping we could close the gap. I have an offer at $100K I'm considering." (+30 LEVERAGE, +30 ESCALATION_RISK)
5. **Ask for Time**: "Can I have a few days to consider this?" (+10 LEVERAGE, shows you have options)

---

### PART 3: THE AFTERMATH (Branching)

#### Scene 13: If You Got What You Wanted
**Location**: office

```
[Confirmation email from HR]

NARRATION:
$95K. Signed. Effective next pay period.

INNER VOICE:
You asked. You got.

Most people don't get raises because they never ask.
Or they ask wrong. Or they have no leverage.

You did all three right.

[You save the email. Documentation.]

INNER VOICE:
The next negotiation? Your annual review.
This new number is your floor.

LESSON:
You're not paid what you're worth.
You're paid what you negotiate.
```

---

#### Scene 14: If You Were Blocked
**Location**: meeting-room → VP's office

```
[Manager said no. Or offered insultingly low. Decision time.]

INNER VOICE:
Options:
1. Accept defeat
2. Go above them
3. Use your BATNA for real

Going above them is risky. Burned bridges.
But sometimes the bridge needs burning.

NARRATION:
Do you escalate?
```

**Choice 10**:
1. **Go to the VP**: "I'd like to discuss my compensation directly with Marcus." (+30 ESCALATION_RISK, +20 LEVERAGE, FLAG: went_above_manager)
2. **Go to HR**: Present your case to Priya as a retention risk (+15 ESCALATION_RISK, +15 LEVERAGE)
3. **Use Your BATNA**: Accept the other offer. Put in notice. (+50 BATNA_QUALITY required, exits company)
4. **Accept Defeat**: Stay, seethe, update resume quietly (-20 LEVERAGE for future)

---

#### Scene 15: The Escalation (If Chosen)
**Location**: VP office

```
[You're in Marcus's office. Derek/Dana is not happy.]

MARCUS: [neutral, direct]
"Derek mentioned you wanted to discuss compensation.
Walk me through your thinking."

INNER VOICE:
You went over your manager's head.
Now you need to make it worth it.

Present the case. Data. Wins. Market.
Don't badmouth Derek. Just... demonstrate.

[You present your documentation]

MARCUS: [reviewing]
"These are solid contributions."

[He sets down the papers]

MARCUS:
"I'll talk to HR. We don't want to lose good people over
preventable issues."

INNER VOICE:
He heard you. But watch your back now.
```

---

## Endings

### EXCELLENT OUTCOMES

**1. The Full Win**
**Trigger**: LEVERAGE > 80, got asking number or above

```
NARRATION:
You got what you asked for.
Maybe more.

The conversation took 30 minutes.
The preparation took a week.
The positioning took months.

INNER VOICE:
This is how compensation works.
Not fairness. Not loyalty. Leverage.

You have it now. Keep building it.

LESSON:
The best time to negotiate is before you need to.
The second best time is today.
```

---

**2. The Promotion Path**
**Trigger**: Strong case, VP involved, FLAG: got_promotion

```
NARRATION:
They couldn't just give you a raise.
Too much politics.

So they promoted you instead.
Same team. New title. New comp band.

$105K. "Senior" in front of your name.

INNER VOICE:
Sometimes the sideways move is the real win.

LESSON:
If they can't pay you more for the same role,
make them give you a different role.
```

---

### GOOD OUTCOMES

**3. The Partial Win**
**Trigger**: Got meaningful increase but less than target

```
NARRATION:
Not everything you asked for.
But more than you had.

And more importantly: you've established yourself
as someone who negotiates.

Next time, they'll remember.

LESSON:
Every negotiation sets the baseline for the next one.
You just raised your baseline.
```

---

**4. The Non-Salary Win**
**Trigger**: Negotiated title/PTO/equity instead of base

```
NARRATION:
They couldn't move on base salary.
So you got creative.

New title. Extra week PTO. Equity grant.

Sometimes the package matters more than the number.

LESSON:
Compensation isn't just salary.
Negotiate the whole picture.
```

---

### NEUTRAL OUTCOMES

**5. The Delay**
**Trigger**: Timeline established, promise made

```
NARRATION:
Not now. But at annual review.
With specific commitments documented.

You follow up in writing:
"Per our conversation, expecting increase to $X
at next review contingent on [deliverables]."

They reply: "Confirmed."

INNER VOICE:
Not a win. But not a loss.
You created accountability.

LESSON:
"Later" is acceptable if it's documented.
Verbal promises are wind.
```

---

### BAD OUTCOMES

**6. The Rejection**
**Trigger**: No increase, no leverage used

```
NARRATION:
They said no.
And you didn't have an alternative.

So you stayed. At the same number.
Knowing you're underpaid.

INNER VOICE:
You asked. That's more than most people do.

But asking isn't enough.
You need leverage. And you didn't have it.

LESSON:
Build your BATNA before you negotiate.
Not during.
```

---

**7. The Burned Bridge**
**Trigger**: Went above manager, didn't get raise, still there

```
NARRATION:
You escalated. It didn't work.
Now Derek/Dana knows you went over their head.

Every interaction is colder now.
Your next project? Less visible.
Your next review? "Meets expectations."

INNER VOICE:
You played the card and lost.

Escalation is a one-time weapon.
Once fired, it doesn't reload.

LESSON:
Know when to escalate. And know when to walk instead.
```

---

**8. The Bluff Called**
**Trigger**: Implied competing offer, didn't have one, they said "take it"

```
DEREK/DANA: [cold]
"If you have a better offer, you should take it.
We can't match outside offers."

INNER VOICE:
They called your bluff. You don't have an offer.

Now what?

NARRATION:
You stay. At the old number.
With everyone knowing you threatened to leave.

And didn't.

LESSON:
Never bluff with a BATNA you don't have.
If you're going to threaten to leave,
be ready to leave.
```

---

**9. The Exit Win**
**Trigger**: BATNA used, left for competing offer

```
NARRATION:
They didn't value you. The market did.

Two weeks notice. Professional handoff.
New job at $100K.

INNER VOICE:
You didn't get a raise. You got something better.

A reminder that you don't need permission
to be paid what you're worth.

LESSON:
Sometimes the best negotiation outcome
is learning you should have left sooner.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backgrounds Needed
- office (general workplace)
- meeting-room (negotiation scenes)
- coffee-shop (intel gathering)
- apartment (documentation/research)
- text-screen (recruiter messages, HR emails)

### Manager Type System
```typescript
// Early choice sets manager type
managerType: 'supportive' | 'threatened' | 'checked_out'

// Affects dialogue and available paths
if (managerType === 'threatened') {
  // More resistance, escalation more likely
  // But also more validation if you win
}
```

### BATNA Quality Thresholds
```typescript
// To successfully use competing offer
if (competing_offer_real && BATNA_QUALITY > 70) → credible threat
if (competing_offer_implied && BATNA_QUALITY < 40) → bluff may be called
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// The anchor
"Based on my contributions and market data, I'm looking at $X."

// The counter
"I appreciate the movement. To make this work, I need $Y."

// The soft BATNA
"I've been getting calls from recruiters. I wanted to talk to you first."

// The hard BATNA
"I have an offer at $X. I'd prefer to stay, but..."

// The documentation ask
"Can you confirm this in writing for my records?"
```

## Inner Voice Style Guide

### During Preparation
```
'Numbers. Specifics. Not feelings.'
'Data doesn't beg. Data demonstrates.'
'Your work doesn't speak. You speak for your work.'
```

### During Negotiation
```
'Anchor high. Justify with data. Stop talking.'
'"Budget is tight" means they don't want to fight for you.'
'First number sets the range. Don't let them set it.'
```

### During Decisions
```
'Escalation is a one-time weapon.'
'Bluff without BATNA = leverage suicide.'
'If you're going to threaten to leave, be ready to leave.'
```

---

## Teaching Moments Summary

1. **Document your wins constantly** - not just before asking
2. **Know your market value** with data, not feelings
3. **Build BATNA before you need it** - talk to recruiters always
4. **Anchor first, anchor high** - the first number sets the range
5. **"Budget" is rarely the real objection** - it's willingness to fight
6. **Never bluff without a real alternative** - they might call it
7. **Going above your manager is nuclear** - use only when necessary
8. **Get everything in writing** - verbal promises evaporate
9. **Sometimes leaving is the best negotiation** - market will pay you
10. **Loyalty without leverage is exploitation** - build power first

---

*Document created for implementation. This scenario teaches that raises aren't rewards for good work—they're outcomes of strategic positioning and negotiation leverage.*
