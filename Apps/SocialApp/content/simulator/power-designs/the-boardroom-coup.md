# The Boardroom Coup

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: VIP
- **Difficulty**: Expert
- **Estimated Scenes**: 32-40
- **Category**: Corporate politics, proxy maneuvering, executive power plays

---

## Logline

The CEO is failing. Everyone sees it. Stock is down 40%. Two major clients gone. The board is restless but loyal—for now. You're the COO. You see what needs to happen. The question isn't whether leadership needs to change. The question is whether you're willing to be the one who changes it—and whether you can survive if it goes wrong.

---

## Core Theme

**The highest-stakes power play in corporate life.** This scenario teaches:
- How to recognize when leadership change is necessary vs. opportunistic
- Building coalitions with board members and executives
- Information asymmetry as a weapon
- The ethics and tactics of succession maneuvering
- Managing the aftermath—win or lose

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The Coup Calculation
Replacing a CEO is a nuclear option. It requires:
1. Clear evidence of failure (not just disagreement)
2. Board support (majority willing to act)
3. A succession plan (usually you or someone you've positioned)
4. Timing (crisis creates opportunity)
5. Deniability (never be seen as the instigator)

### Key Frameworks

**1. The Information Advantage**
You know things the board doesn't. The question is how to surface that information without seeming disloyal.

**2. Proxy Warfare**
Direct attacks fail. The goal is to create conditions where others reach the conclusion you want. You plant seeds, others water them.

**3. The Coalition**
You need board allies. CFO support helps. HR support is essential for transition. Never move until you have the votes.

**4. Succession Positioning**
If the CEO goes, someone fills the vacuum. If you're not positioned, you enabled someone else's rise.

**5. The Fail-Safe**
If this fails, your career at this company is over. Have an exit ready. Always.

### The Ethical Line

| Legitimate | Crossing the Line |
|-----------|------------------|
| Sharing concerns with board | Fabricating problems |
| Building relationships with directors | Secretly promising board seats |
| Positioning for succession | Sabotaging the CEO's initiatives |
| Surfacing real failures | Leaking confidential information |
| Advocating for change | Organizing behind closed doors without transparency |

## Characters

### You (The COO)
Number two. You see everything. You could run this company. If the current CEO wasn't in the way.

### Richard - The CEO
**Role**: Failing but entrenched. Has board relationships from the early days. Not going quietly.

**Voice Example**:
> "The market is overreacting. We need to stay the course.
> Our strategy is sound. Execution is the issue—and I'm addressing it."

---

### Victoria - Board Chair
**Role**: Key decision-maker. Pragmatic. Loyal to the company, not to Richard.

**Voice Example**:
> "I'm concerned about the direction.
> But changing leadership mid-crisis is its own risk.
> What's the alternative?"

---

### Marcus - CFO (Potential Ally)
**Role**: Sees the numbers. Knows the truth. Could support you—or stay neutral.

**Voice Example**:
> "The Q3 projections are fiction. Richard knows it.
> I can't keep presenting these to the board."

---

### Elena - Board Member (Swing Vote)
**Role**: Newer to the board. Less loyal to Richard. Wants results.

**Voice Example**:
> "I didn't join this board to watch the company stagnate.
> If leadership isn't working, leadership should change."

---

### James - Board Member (Richard's Ally)
**Role**: Old guard. Richard hired him. Will defend the CEO.

**Voice Example**:
> "Richard built this company. One rough year doesn't erase that.
> We need to give him time to execute."

---

### Chen - SVP Strategy (Your Ally)
**Role**: Loyal to you. Provides intel and support.

**Voice Example**:
> "I'm with you if you decide to move.
> But if this fails, we're both finished here."

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: ASSESSMENT

#### Scene 1: The State of Things
**Location**: office

```
NARRATION:
Stock down 40% this year.
Two anchor clients lost.
Third restructuring in 18 months.

[You review the numbers Richard presented to the board]

INNER VOICE:
These projections aren't just optimistic.
They're detached from reality.

[Email from Chen]
"We need to talk. Richard's latest strategy memo
is going to accelerate the decline."

INNER VOICE:
Everyone can see it.
The CEO is failing.
And the board isn't acting.

The question is: should you?
```

---

#### Scene 2: The Calculation
**Location**: apartment (night)

```
INNER VOICE:
Be honest with yourself.

Is this about the company?
Or is this about you wanting the job?

[Both can be true]

INNER VOICE:
Richard is failing. That's objective.
You could do better. That's also true.
The company needs change. That's obvious.

But engineering that change—
that's different from observing it.

NARRATION:
What's driving you?
```

**Choice 1 (Sets ethical frame)**:
1. "The company will die under Richard. I have a responsibility to act." (+15 ethical grounding)
2. "This is my opportunity. Richard's failure is my opening." (+15 honest ambition)
3. "Both. I want the job AND I can save the company." (+10 both, realistic)
4. "I need to think about this more carefully." (+10 caution)

---

#### Scene 3: Assessing the Board
**Location**: office

```
INNER VOICE:
The board has seven members.
You need four for a majority.

[Board map:]

VICTORIA (Chair) - Pragmatic. Open to change if convinced.
JAMES - Richard's ally. Will vote to keep him.
ELENA - Frustrated. Wants results.
DAVID - Silent. Hard to read.
MICHAEL - Risk-averse. Fears transition chaos.
SARAH - Newer. Aligned with Victoria.
ROBERT - Old guard. Respects Richard but respects results more.

INNER VOICE:
James is a guaranteed no.
Elena and Sarah are likely yes if you have Victoria.
David and Michael are swing votes.
Robert could go either way.

You need Victoria. She's the key.
```

---

#### Scene 4: Sounding Out Marcus
**Location**: office (CFO's office)

```
[Closed door with Marcus, CFO]

YOU:
"How bad are the real numbers?"

MARCUS: [pause]
"Off the record? We miss Q3 targets by 30%.
Richard's projections are... aspirational."

[pause]

MARCUS:
"The board doesn't know how bad it is.
Richard is managing information."

YOU:
"What would happen if they knew?"

MARCUS: [studies you]
"That's a loaded question."

INNER VOICE:
He knows what you're thinking.
Is he with you?
```

**Choice 2**:
1. **Be direct**: "Richard needs to go. Would you support a change?" (+20 MARCUS alignment if he agrees, -30 if he reports to Richard)
2. **Stay indirect**: "I'm just trying to understand the picture." (+10 intel, no commitment)
3. **Plant seed**: "The board deserves accurate information." (+15 BOARD support indirectly)
4. **Test loyalty**: "You know, if things changed, a new CEO would need a strong CFO." (+15 MARCUS alignment, -10 DENIABILITY)

---

### PART 2: THE CAMPAIGN

#### Scene 5: Victoria Conversation
**Location**: restaurant (private dinner)

```
[Dinner with Victoria, Board Chair - ostensibly "strategic update"]

VICTORIA:
"I appreciate you reaching out.
Tell me what you're seeing."

INNER VOICE:
This is the critical conversation.
Too aggressive, you look disloyal.
Too passive, nothing changes.

NARRATION:
How do you frame the situation?
```

**Choice 3 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Concerned operator**: "I'm seeing challenges in execution. I wanted to share my perspective as someone in the trenches." (+20 VICTORIA_ALIGNMENT, +15 DENIABILITY)
2. **Direct assessment**: "The current strategy isn't working. The board should know the real numbers." (+25 VICTORIA_ALIGNMENT, -10 DENIABILITY)
3. **Succession positioning**: "I'm committed to this company. Whatever the board decides, I want to be part of the solution." (+15 YOUR_POSITIONING, +10 DENIABILITY)
4. **Let her lead**: "I wanted to hear your perspective on the direction." (+10 VICTORIA_ALIGNMENT, +20 DENIABILITY)

---

#### Scene 6: Victoria's Response
**Location**: restaurant

```
VICTORIA: [after listening carefully]
"I appreciate your candor.
I've had similar concerns."

[pause]

VICTORIA:
"The challenge is that Richard has relationships on this board.
Changing leadership mid-crisis is risky.
And frankly, the question is—who would replace him?"

[She's looking at you directly]

INNER VOICE:
She's asking if you want the job.
This is the moment.

NARRATION:
What do you say?
```

**Choice 4**:
1. **Step forward**: "If the board decided change was needed, I'm prepared to step up." (+25 YOUR_POSITIONING, -15 DENIABILITY)
2. **Humble availability**: "I'm not campaigning. But I wouldn't walk away from responsibility if asked." (+20 YOUR_POSITIONING, +10 DENIABILITY)
3. **Deflect**: "That's a board decision. I'm just sharing what I'm seeing." (+20 DENIABILITY, -10 YOUR_POSITIONING)
4. **External suggestion**: "You might consider an external search if internal options aren't compelling." (-15 YOUR_POSITIONING, +25 DENIABILITY)

---

#### Scene 7: Richard Suspects
**Location**: office

```
[Richard stops by your office. Unusual.]

RICHARD: [too casual]
"I heard you had dinner with Victoria.
Anything I should know about?"

INNER VOICE:
He knows. Or suspects.

RICHARD:
"I'm sure you're keeping me informed
about any board conversations."

[It's not a question. It's a warning.]

INNER VOICE:
Deny and reassure?
Or signal that things are in motion?
```

**Choice 5**:
1. **Full reassurance**: "Of course. Just building relationships. Happy to brief you." (+20 DENIABILITY, buys time)
2. **Minimal response**: "Just a check-in. Nothing material." (+10 DENIABILITY)
3. **Subtle warning**: "The board has concerns. They're going to ask questions regardless." (-10 DENIABILITY, +10 CEO_VULNERABILITY)
4. **Deflect**: "You'd have to ask Victoria what she's thinking." (Neutral, doesn't commit)

---

#### Scene 8: Building the Coalition
**Location**: multiple (series of meetings)

```
NARRATION:
Over the next three weeks, you have conversations.

[Elena - Board Member]
"I'm frustrated with the lack of progress.
If there's appetite for change, I'm open."

[Sarah - Board Member]
"I follow Victoria's lead, generally.
If she's convinced, I'll listen."

[David - Swing Vote]
"I need to see a clear plan. Who leads?
What's different? I won't vote for chaos."

INNER VOICE:
Elena is a yes. Sarah follows Victoria.
David needs a succession plan.
James is a hard no.
Michael and Robert are still unclear.

The math is possible. But not certain.
```

---

#### Scene 9: The Trigger Event
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Q3 Results - Private board preview]

MARCUS:
"Revenue missed by 32%. EBITDA by 45%.
The client losses are accelerating."

[Board members shifting uncomfortably]

RICHARD:
"We're taking action. The restructuring will show results in Q4.
I remain confident in our direction."

[Victoria's expression is unreadable]

INNER VOICE:
The numbers are damning.
Richard's response is the same as always.
'Stay the course. Trust me.'

This might be the moment.
```

---

### PART 3: THE MOMENT

#### Scene 10: Pre-Board Meeting
**Location**: office (with Chen)

```
CHEN:
"Victoria called an executive session.
Just the board. No management.
That only happens when they're discussing leadership."

INNER VOICE:
It's happening. One way or another.

CHEN:
"Do you have the votes?"

YOU:
"I think so. Victoria, Elena, Sarah likely.
I need David or Robert. Maybe both."

CHEN:
"And if it fails?"

[pause]

YOU:
"Then we update our resumes."

INNER VOICE:
No going back now.
```

---

#### Scene 11: The Board Meeting
**Location**: meeting-room (board room)

```
[You're not in the room. You're waiting.]

[Two hours pass]

[Victoria emerges. Her face gives nothing away.]

VICTORIA:
"We'd like you to join us."

[You enter. Richard is still seated.
His face is stone. But something's different.]

VICTORIA:
"The board has been discussing leadership.
We've made a decision."
```

---

#### Scene 12: The Outcome
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[BRANCH: Success]

VICTORIA:
"Richard has agreed to step down as CEO.
Effective immediately.

The board has voted to appoint you as interim CEO,
with a six-month review for permanent status."

[Richard stands. Doesn't look at you.]

RICHARD:
"I wish you well."

[He leaves]

INNER VOICE:
You did it.
Now comes the hard part: actually running the company.

---

[BRANCH: Failure]

VICTORIA:
"The board has confidence in Richard's leadership.
We're giving him six more months to execute
the turnaround plan.

We appreciate your candor. But the decision is made."

[Richard looks at you. Slight smile.]

INNER VOICE:
You lost.
And everyone knows you tried.
Your time here is measured in weeks.
```

---

## Endings

### COUP SUCCEEDED

**1. The New CEO**
**Trigger**: Majority board support, succession secured

```
NARRATION:
Six months later.
Stock is up 15%. Clients stabilizing.
The board removed "interim" from your title.

VICTORIA:
"The board is pleased with the direction.
You've proven us right."

INNER VOICE:
You saw what was needed.
You did what was necessary.
And you executed.

LESSON:
The highest level of corporate power
isn't given. It's taken.
But only when the taking is justified
and the execution is flawless.
```

---

**2. The Pyrrhic Victory**
**Trigger**: Won but damaged relationships, external pressure

```
NARRATION:
You're CEO. But the costs are visible.

[Wall Street Journal: "Boardroom Coup at [Company]"]

INNER VOICE:
The narrative isn't "new leadership saves company."
The narrative is "political maneuvering ousts founder."

You won. But the perception lingers.

LESSON:
Even successful coups have costs.
How you win matters as much as whether you win.
```

---

### COUP FAILED

**3. The Graceful Exit**
**Trigger**: Lost but positioned well externally

```
NARRATION:
Richard survived. You didn't.

[Resignation letter]
"I've accepted a CEO position at [competitor].
I wish the company well."

INNER VOICE:
You lost this fight.
But you positioned for the next one.

LESSON:
Failed coups end careers at that company.
Smart players have the next move ready.
```

---

**4. The Total Loss**
**Trigger**: Lost, no exit prepared, reputation damaged

```
NARRATION:
Richard survived and retaliated.

[Leaked to press: "COO attempted power grab"]

INNER VOICE:
No job. No reference. Damaged reputation.

You swung for the CEO seat.
You missed.
And everything fell.

LESSON:
Never attempt a coup without an exit.
The stakes are total.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Coalition Math
```typescript
// Board vote calculation
votes = {
  victoria: VICTORIA_ALIGNMENT > 60,
  elena: true, // likely yes
  sarah: VICTORIA_ALIGNMENT > 50, // follows Victoria
  david: YOUR_POSITIONING > 70, // needs succession plan
  james: false, // Richard's ally
  michael: CEO_VULNERABILITY > 80, // risk-averse
  robert: BOARD_SUPPORT > 60 // respects results
}

if (votes.filter(v => v).length >= 4) → coup_succeeds
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Surfacing concerns
"I'm seeing challenges in execution. I wanted to share my perspective."

// Succession positioning
"If the board decided change was needed, I'm prepared to step up."

// Deniability
"I'm not campaigning. I'm just sharing what I'm seeing."
```

## Inner Voice Style Guide

### Assessment
```
'Is this about the company? Or about you wanting the job?'
'Everyone can see it. The CEO is failing. The board isn't acting.'
'You need Victoria. She's the key.'
```

### Campaign
```
'She's asking if you want the job. This is the moment.'
'He knows. Or suspects.'
'The math is possible. But not certain.'
```

### Moment
```
'No going back now.'
'You did it. Now comes the hard part.'
'You swung for the CEO seat. You missed.'
```
