## Logline

Something's wrong. Your projects keep hitting unexpected obstacles. Your ideas get shot down before you finish explaining them. Leadership seems colder lately. You thought it was bad luck—until you discovered it's not luck at all. Someone is actively working against you. And they sit three desks away, smiling.

---

## Core Theme

**Detecting and neutralizing covert professional sabotage.** This scenario teaches:
- How to recognize you're being undermined (it's rarely obvious)
- Information gathering and counter-surveillance
- Narrative control—your story vs. theirs
- The calculus of confrontation vs. strategic counter-moves
- Documenting and escalating without looking paranoid

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### Why Backstabbing Works
Backstabbers succeed because:
1. They're covert—you don't see it coming
2. They're patient—damage accumulates slowly
3. They control the narrative—others hear their version first
4. Victims look paranoid when they complain—"I'm being undermined" sounds crazy

### Key Frameworks

**1. The Pattern Recognition Test**
One problem is bad luck. Two is a coincidence. Three is a pattern. Pay attention to when things go wrong—and who benefits.

**2. The Information Network**
You can't fight what you can't see. Build relationships that give you visibility into what's being said when you're not there.

**3. Narrative Control**
The backstabber is telling a story about you. You need to tell a better one—proactively, not reactively.

**4. The Confrontation Calculation**
Direct confrontation is satisfying but risky. It alerts them you're onto them, and you may not have proof. Sometimes indirect neutralization is smarter.

**5. Documentation Defense**
If it escalates, you need receipts. Dates, witnesses, specific incidents. "I feel like I'm being sabotaged" loses to "Here are 12 documented incidents."

### The Backstabber's Playbook

| Tactic | How It Looks | The Damage |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Credit theft** | "Great idea that THE TEAM came up with" | Your contributions become invisible |
| **Negative framing** | "They mean well, but they're still learning" | Planted doubt in leadership |
| **Meeting sabotage** | Pre-meetings, sidebar conversations | Decisions made before you arrive |
| **Info blockades** | "Oh, I thought you knew" | You're out of the loop, look incompetent |
| **Subtle criticism** | "Just raising a concern" | Death by a thousand cuts |
| **Alliance building** | Befriends your manager, skip-level | Insulates from consequences |

## Characters

### You (The Target)
Something's wrong. Time to figure out what—and who.

### Alex - The Backstabber
**Role**: Colleague. Smiles to your face. Destroys you behind your back.
**Type**: Strategic, patient, plausibly deniable. Never does anything "wrong" enough to call out.

**Voice Example** (To your face):
> "How's the Henderson project going? Let me know if you need anything.
> I'm always happy to help."

**Voice Example** (To your manager, when you're not there):
> "I'm a little worried about Henderson. [Name] seems overwhelmed.
> Should we think about adding support?"

---

### Chen - Your Manager
**Role**: Can either protect you or be manipulated by Alex.
**Variable**: Has Alex already gotten to them?

**Voice Example** (If not yet manipulated):
> "You seem stressed lately. Is everything okay?"

**Voice Example** (If Alex's narrative is landing):
> "I'm hearing some concerns about your workload management..."

---

### Morgan - The Witness
**Role**: Someone who's noticed the pattern. Potential ally.

**Voice Example**:
> "You know Alex has been having a lot of sidebar conversations
> with Chen lately, right? Before meetings?"

---

### Priya - The Network
**Role**: Connected across the organization. Hears things.

**Voice Example**:
> "I probably shouldn't tell you this, but...
> Alex told the VP that Henderson was 'at risk' because of 'team dynamics.'"

---

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: SOMETHING'S WRONG

#### Scene 1: The First Sign
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Department meeting. You're presenting the Henderson approach.]

YOU:
"So for phase two, I'm recommending we—"

ALEX: [interrupting, smooth]
"Actually, I was talking to Chen earlier, and we discussed
some concerns about the timeline. Maybe we should pause
on phase two until we've validated phase one results?"

CHEN: [nodding]
"That's a good point. Let's hold on phase two for now."

INNER VOICE:
Wait. When did Alex talk to Chen?
And why are they presenting YOUR project's concerns?

[You look at Chen. Something's off.]

INNER VOICE:
That's the third time this month your proposal
hit unexpected resistance.

Coincidence?
```

---

#### Scene 2: The Pattern Emerges
**Location**: office (your desk)

```
NARRATION:
You start reviewing the last three months.

[Mental timeline]

- February: Your budget proposal rejected. Alex's approved.
- March: Henderson kickoff—Alex raises "concerns" unprompted.
- March: Skip-level with VP gets rescheduled three times.
- April: Your update email gets no response. Alex's gets replied to immediately.
- April: Chen seems distant. Colder.

INNER VOICE:
Once is bad luck.
Twice is coincidence.
This is neither.

Something is happening.
And it's not random.
```

---

#### Scene 3: The Witness
**Location**: office-kitchen

```
[Coffee break. Morgan catches you alone.]

MORGAN: [lowered voice]
"Hey. Can I tell you something?"

[You nod]

MORGAN:
"I've been noticing something with Alex.
They have a lot of... conversations with Chen.
Right before meetings. About your projects."

INNER VOICE:
Pre-meetings. Classic.

MORGAN:
"I don't know what they're saying, but...
it never seems like good news for you."

INNER VOICE:
You're not imagining it.
Someone else sees it too.
```

**Choice 1**:
1. **Dig deeper**: "What else have you noticed?" (+20 AWARENESS, +15 NETWORK_INTELLIGENCE, FLAG: found_witness)
2. **Stay cautious**: "Thanks for telling me. Keep me posted." (+10 AWARENESS)
3. **Dismiss it**: "I'm sure it's nothing." (-15 AWARENESS)
4. **Strategic silence**: Note it, but don't show your cards (+10 AWARENESS, +5 caution)

---

#### Scene 4: The Intel
**Location**: coffee-shop

```
[Priya, who knows everyone's business]

PRIYA:
"You didn't hear this from me."

[pause]

PRIYA:
"Alex told Marcus—the VP, not your Marcus—
that Henderson was 'at risk' because of 'team dynamics.'"

INNER VOICE:
'Team dynamics.' That's code for 'problem with you.'

PRIYA:
"They also mentioned being 'concerned about bandwidth issues.'
Whatever that means."

INNER VOICE:
It means Alex is telling leadership you can't handle the job.
While smiling to your face every morning.

This is warfare. And you just discovered you're in it.
```

**Choice 2**:
1. **React emotionally**: "Are you serious? I'm going to confront them." (-10 strategic thinking)
2. **Gather more intel**: "What else have they said? Who else have they talked to?" (+20 NETWORK_INTELLIGENCE, FLAG: priya_intel)
3. **Start documenting**: "I need to write this down. With dates." (+20 DOCUMENTATION)
4. **Plan counter-narrative**: "I need to get ahead of this story." (+15 COUNTER_NARRATIVE)

---

### PART 2: COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE

#### Scene 5: The Strategy Session
**Location**: apartment

```
NARRATION:
You know what's happening now.
The question is what to do about it.

INNER VOICE:
Options:

1. Direct confrontation - "I know what you're doing"
   Risk: They deny everything, escalate subtly

2. Strategic counter - Build your narrative, neutralize theirs
   Risk: Takes time, they keep working

3. Escalate to Chen - "Alex is undermining me"
   Risk: Look paranoid without proof

4. Document and wait - Build the case, strike when ready
   Risk: Damage continues while you wait

NARRATION:
Which approach do you take?
```

**Choice 3 - MAJOR BRANCH**:
1. **Build counter-narrative first**: Strengthen your position before engaging (+20 COUNTER_NARRATIVE)
2. **Private confrontation**: Face Alex directly, see what happens (+15 AWARENESS of their reaction)
3. **Manager conversation**: Tell Chen what you're seeing (+15 MANAGER_TRUST attempt)
4. **Document systematically**: Create paper trail before acting (+25 DOCUMENTATION)

---

#### Scene 6: Building the Counter-Narrative
**Location**: office/multiple

```
[If chose counter-narrative path]

NARRATION:
You can't just refute Alex's story.
You need to tell a better one.

[Your approach:]

1. Increase visibility with leadership
2. Share wins widely and proactively
3. Build direct relationships with decision-makers
4. Make your competence undeniable

[Email to VP Marcus]
"Quick update on Henderson—ahead of schedule and under budget.
Happy to walk you through the approach."

[Meeting with Chen—proactive]
"I wanted to give you a direct update. Everything's on track.
Here's my plan for phase two."

INNER VOICE:
You're not defending yourself.
You're making their narrative impossible to believe.
```

---

#### Scene 7: The Private Confrontation
**Location**: office-hallway

```
[If chose direct confrontation]

YOU:
"Alex. Can we talk? Privately."

ALEX: [smile, slightly wary]
"Sure. What's up?"

[Empty conference room]

YOU:
"I'm going to be direct.
I know you've been having conversations about me.
About Henderson. About my 'bandwidth.'

I'd like to understand what's happening."

[Alex's expression flickers. Then smooths.]

ALEX:
"I'm not sure what you mean.
I've been supportive of you."

[pause]

ALEX:
"If anything, I've been trying to help.
Maybe you're taking collaboration as criticism?"

INNER VOICE:
The pivot. Now YOU'RE the problem.

Classic backstabber defense.
```

**Choice 4**:
1. **Press harder**: "Cut the bullshit. I know what you told Marcus." (+10 ALEX_EXPOSED, -10 escalation risk)
2. **Play the long game**: "I see. Thanks for clarifying." (Retreat strategically, they're now aware)
3. **Set a boundary**: "I just want to be clear—I handle my own narratives." (+10 COUNTER_NARRATIVE)
4. **Threaten**: "If this continues, I'll escalate." (May backfire, +10 ALEX_EXPOSED)

---

#### Scene 8: The Manager Conversation
**Location**: meeting-room (Chen's office)

```
[If chose manager path]

CHEN:
"What's on your mind?"

INNER VOICE:
Careful. If Alex got here first, you'll sound paranoid.

YOU:
"I've noticed some patterns I want to raise.
Specifically around communication before meetings.
I'm hearing my projects discussed before I'm present."

CHEN: [neutral, listening]
"Go on."

YOU:
"I want to make sure you're hearing directly from me.
Not filtered through anyone else."

CHEN:
[pause]
"I appreciate you saying that.
I've noticed some... dynamics. I wasn't sure what to make of them."

INNER VOICE:
Chen sees something. They weren't sure whose story to believe.

You just showed up.
```

**Choice 5**:
1. **Be specific**: "Here's what I've documented." (+25 MANAGER_TRUST, +15 DOCUMENTATION use)
2. **Stay general**: "I just want transparency." (+15 MANAGER_TRUST)
3. **Name Alex**: "To be direct—I'm concerned about Alex's behavior." (High risk, +20 or -20 depending on Chen's reaction)
4. **Ask for protection**: "Can you ensure I'm informed of all discussions about my projects?" (+10 MANAGER_TRUST)

---

### PART 3: RESOLUTION

#### Scene 9: Alex Escalates
**Location**: office

```
[If Alex realizes you're onto them]

NARRATION:
Alex knows now. And they're not backing down.

[Developments:]
- Your next project gets assigned to Alex instead
- Alex starts CC'ing leadership on minor issues
- Sidebar conversations increase, not decrease
- You're left off a key meeting invitation

ALEX: [passing your desk, friendly]
"Hey! Hope the new structure works out.
Let me know if you need help transitioning."

INNER VOICE:
They're not retreating. They're accelerating.

This just became open warfare.
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **Escalate to HR**: "I need to document a pattern of workplace interference." (+30 DOCUMENTATION use, high stakes)
2. **Skip-level to VP**: Go above Chen, above Alex, directly to power (+25 ALEX_EXPOSED, risk of bypassing manager)
3. **Build coalition**: Unite others who've been affected (+20 NETWORK_INTELLIGENCE)
4. **Exit preparation**: "Time to find a new job." (+25 EXIT_READINESS)

---

#### Scene 10: The Documentation Meeting
**Location**: meeting-room (HR)

```
[If escalated to HR with documentation]

HR REP:
"Thank you for bringing this forward.
Walk me through what you've documented."

[You present:]
- 14 specific incidents with dates
- 3 witnesses willing to corroborate
- Email threads showing pattern
- Impact on your projects and reputation

HR REP: [reviewing]
"This is thorough."

[pause]

HR REP:
"We'll need to investigate.
I should tell you—investigations don't always resolve
the way employees expect."

INNER VOICE:
Translation: they might do nothing.

But at least it's on record.
```

---

## Endings

### SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES

**1. Alex Neutralized**
**Trigger**: ALEX_EXPOSED > 80, documentation solid, manager support

```
NARRATION:
It took three months.
But Alex's behavior became visible to the right people.

CHEN: [in private]
"I've had conversations with HR about Alex.
This won't continue."

INNER VOICE:
They're not fired. But they're contained.
Their credibility is damaged.
Their access to you is limited.

LESSON:
Backstabbers survive in shadows.
Sunlight is disinfectant.
Make their behavior visible.
```

---

**2. The Strategic Victory**
**Trigger**: COUNTER_NARRATIVE > 80, reputation intact, Alex marginalized

```
NARRATION:
You didn't destroy Alex.
You just made yourself un-destroyable.

Every story they tell about you doesn't land.
Because leadership knows the truth firsthand.

INNER VOICE:
The best defense against narrative warfare?
Tell your story first. Tell it better. Tell it often.

Alex is still here. But their weapon doesn't work anymore.

LESSON:
You can't always remove the threat.
But you can make yourself immune to it.
```

---

### PARTIAL OUTCOMES

**3. The Stalemate**
**Trigger**: Both sides aware, neither winning, tense coexistence

```
NARRATION:
You know about Alex. Alex knows you know.
Neither of you has landed a killing blow.

Every meeting is a chess match.
Every email is carefully worded.
Every conversation has an audience.

INNER VOICE:
This isn't resolution. It's cold war.

LESSON:
Sometimes the best outcome is deterrence.
They know you'll fight back.
That's worth something.
```

---

**4. The Exit Win**
**Trigger**: Used situation for external leverage, landed better job

```
NARRATION:
You couldn't win this fight.
So you won a different one.

New job. 35% increase. Better culture.

INNER VOICE:
Not every battle is worth fighting.
Sometimes the win is walking away
to something better.

LESSON:
If the environment is toxic,
fixing it isn't your job.
Finding a better one is.
```

---

### BAD OUTCOMES

**5. The Paranoid Label**
**Trigger**: Escalated without proof, looked unstable

```
NARRATION:
You told Chen. You went to HR.
You named Alex directly.

But you didn't have the documentation.
You didn't have witnesses.
You had suspicions and feelings.

HR: [after investigation]
"We didn't find evidence to support your concerns."

CHEN: [later, carefully]
"Maybe some time off would help."

INNER VOICE:
You were right about Alex.
But you couldn't prove it.
And now YOU look like the problem.

LESSON:
Never accuse without evidence.
Suspicion without proof destroys credibility.
```

---

**6. Alex Wins**
**Trigger**: Didn't counter, didn't document, narrative stuck

```
NARRATION:
Six months later.
Your projects are gone.
Your reputation is damaged.
Your promotion is stalled.

And Alex is rising.

INNER VOICE:
They played the game.
You didn't realize there was one.

LESSON:
Not everyone plays fair.
Recognizing that isn't cynicism.
It's survival.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Detection Arc
```typescript
// Early stats determine how quickly you recognize the threat
if (AWARENESS > 50 by scene 5) {
  early_detection = true
  more_counter_options_available = true
}
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// Alex's face vs. reality
public: "Let me know if you need anything. Always happy to help."
private_to_manager: "I'm concerned about their bandwidth..."

// Your counter-narrative
"Quick update—ahead of schedule and under budget."
"I wanted to give you a direct update."

// Confrontation
"I'm going to be direct. I know you've been having conversations about me."
```

### Documentation Strength Requirements
```typescript
// To successfully escalate to HR
if (DOCUMENTATION > 70 && specific_incidents > 10 && witnesses > 2) {
  hr_takes_seriously = true
} else {
  risk_of_paranoid_label = high
}
```

## Teaching Moments Summary

1. **Recognize patterns** - one problem is luck, three is a pattern
2. **Build information networks** - you can't fight what you can't see
3. **Control your narrative proactively** - tell your story first
4. **Document everything** - dates, witnesses, specific incidents
5. **Never accuse without proof** - suspicion without evidence destroys credibility
6. **Pre-meetings are power moves** - decisions often happen before the meeting
7. **Direct confrontation is risky** - it alerts them and you may not have proof
