# The First 90 Days

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: Free
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Estimated Scenes**: 26-32
- **Category**: New job navigation, political mapping, first impressions

---

## Logline

Day one. New badge. New desk. Thirty faces you don't know, all of them already deciding if you're a threat, an ally, or irrelevant. The next 90 days will determine whether you rise, stall, or become the person everyone forgets to invite to meetings. The clock is already ticking.

---

## Core Theme

**The first 90 days aren't about doing good work—they're about positioning.** This scenario teaches:
- How to map the political landscape fast
- The difference between the org chart and the real power structure
- Building alliances before you need them
- Avoiding the traps that sink new hires
- When to stay quiet and when to make noise

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The New Hire Paradox
You're being evaluated before you've done anything. First impressions calcify fast. By day 30, most people have decided who you are—and changing that perception takes 10x more effort than setting it right initially.

### Key Frameworks

**1. The 30-60-90 Rule**
- Days 1-30: Listen, learn, map the terrain
- Days 31-60: Demonstrate value, build relationships
- Days 61-90: Establish your brand, claim territory

**2. The Org Chart vs. Reality**
The org chart shows reporting lines. Real power flows through influence, information, and relationships. Find the people who actually make decisions—they're rarely who you'd expect.

**3. First Wins Matter More Than Big Wins**
Don't try to revolutionize the company in month one. Find a small, visible problem and solve it. Early wins build credibility for later moves.

**4. Political Mapping**
Who's rising? Who's falling? Who has the CEO's ear? Who's about to be pushed out? Read the room before you play in it.

**5. The Over-Eager Trap**
New hires who try too hard look desperate. New hires who critique everything look arrogant. The sweet spot: curious, capable, humble—but not invisible.

### Professional vs. Dark Arts

| Situation | Professional Approach | Dark Arts Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Learning the landscape | Ask direct questions, take notes | Befriend the admin assistants—they know everything |
| First project | Do solid work, deliver on time | Deliver early, make sure the right people notice |
| Office politics | Stay neutral, focus on work | Map alliances early, align with rising stars |
| Predecessor comparison | Learn from what they did | Subtly distance yourself from their failures |
| Making allies | Be helpful to everyone | Identify the three most powerful people, prioritize them |

## Characters

### You (The New Hire)
First week. High expectations. Every interaction matters.

### Harper - Your Manager
**Role**: Direct boss. Hired you. Their reputation is tied to your success.
**Variables**: Hands-off or micromanager? Secure or threatened?

**Voice Example** (Supportive):
> "I'm here if you need me, but I trust you. That's why I hired you."

**Voice Example** (Hands-off to a fault):
> "Just jump in. You'll figure it out. That's how I did it."

---

### Devon - The Peer (Ally Path)
**Role**: Same level as you. Could be ally or competitor.
**Type**: Genuinely helpful. Secure in their position. Good intel source.

**Voice Example**:
> "Let me show you the real way things work around here.
> The onboarding materials are... optimistic."

---

### Cameron - The Peer (Threat Path)
**Role**: Same level as you. Wanted your job. Didn't get it.
**Type**: Smiling to your face. Watching for your mistakes.

**Voice Example**:
> "Welcome! Let me know if you need anything at all.
> I've been here three years—I know where all the bodies are buried."

**Inner Voice Read**:
> That smile didn't reach their eyes.

---

### Morgan - The Admin/Executive Assistant
**Role**: "Just" an admin. Actually knows everything.
**Superpower**: Controls calendars, knows everyone's business, invisible to executives.

**Voice Example**:
> "Between us? Don't bring up the Q3 project in front of Victor.
> Trust me."

---

### Victor - The Senior Director
**Role**: Two levels up. Real power in the department.
**Type**: Watches new hires. Forms opinions quickly.

**Voice Example**:
> "You're the new hire? Harper's told me good things.
> Let's see if you live up to them."

---

### Riley - The Predecessor (Mentioned/Flashbacks)
**Role**: The person who had your job before you. Why did they leave?
**Variables**: Fired? Promoted? Quit? The story matters.

---

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: WEEK ONE

#### Scene 1: Day One
**Location**: office-lobby

```
NARRATION:
8:47 AM. First day. New badge clipped to your shirt.

The elevator opens to a floor of faces you don't know.
Some glance up. Some don't.

INNER VOICE:
Every single one of them is already forming an opinion.
Too eager? Too aloof? Too quiet? Too loud?

You haven't said a word yet.
And they're already deciding who you are.

[Harper approaches with a smile]

HARPER: [happy, professional]
"Welcome! Ready to meet the team?"

INNER VOICE:
Game starts now.
```

---

#### Scene 2: The Team Meeting
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[You're in a conference room. Eight faces around the table.]

HARPER:
"Everyone, this is [Name], our new [role].
[Name], why don't you tell us a bit about yourself?"

INNER VOICE:
The introduction. Thirty seconds to set the first impression.

Too humble = forgettable
Too confident = threatening
Just right = curious about them, clear about you

NARRATION:
What's your approach?
```

**Choice 1**:
1. **Brief and Curious**: Quick background, then "I'm excited to learn from all of you." (+10 REPUTATION, balanced)
2. **Confident and Clear**: Solid overview of credentials and what you bring (+10 REPUTATION with some, -5 with threatened peers)
3. **Humble and Deferring**: "I'm just here to learn and help where I can." (-5 REPUTATION, too invisible)
4. **Oversharing**: Full career history, passions, hobbies (eyes glaze, -10 REPUTATION)

---

#### Scene 3: The Tour
**Location**: office (walking)

```
[Devon offers to show you around]

DEVON:
"I'll give you the real tour. Not the HR version."

[Walking through the floor]

DEVON: [lowered voice]
"That corner? Victor's team. They run the department.
If Victor likes you, you're golden.
If he doesn't... well."

[pause]

DEVON:
"The kitchen? That's where the real information flows.
Grab coffee at 10:15. That's when the VPs take their break."

INNER VOICE:
This is the real org chart.
Pay attention.
```

**Choice 2**:
1. Ask follow-up questions, take mental notes (+15 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, FLAG: mapped_power_structure)
2. "Thanks, I'll figure it out as I go." (Miss the intel)
3. "Who should I avoid?" (Risky question—tests Devon's trust) (+10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, -5 if Devon isn't trustworthy)

---

#### Scene 4: Lunch Politics
**Location**: office-cafeteria

```
NARRATION:
Lunch. Where you sit matters more than what you eat.

[You scan the cafeteria]

Table 1: Your immediate team. Safe. Expected.
Table 2: Devon and a few others. Friendly invite.
Table 3: Cameron and their group. Cameron's waving you over.
Table 4: Alone. Catch up on emails.

INNER VOICE:
Eating alone on day one says "I don't need people."
Eating with the wrong group says you've picked a side.

Who do you choose?
```

**Choice 3**:
1. Team table - safe, expected (+5 NETWORK_STRENGTH, neutral politically)
2. Devon's table - building the ally relationship (+10 NETWORK_STRENGTH with Devon's group)
3. Cameron's table - keep your enemy close (+5 NETWORK_STRENGTH, +10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS about Cameron)
4. Alone - you have emails to catch up on (-10 REPUTATION, "doesn't play well with others")

---

#### Scene 5: First One-on-One with Harper
**Location**: meeting-room (Harper's office)

```
HARPER:
"So. First impressions?"

INNER VOICE:
Trap question. They're not asking for criticism.
They're asking if you're smart enough to be diplomatic.

NARRATION:
What do you say?
```

**Choice 4**:
1. **Diplomatic positive**: "Everyone's been welcoming. I'm getting up to speed." (+10 MANAGER_TRUST)
2. **Curious questions**: "Good so far. Can you tell me more about the team dynamics?" (+10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, shows awareness)
3. **Honest observations**: Share something you noticed (risky—depends on what you say)
4. **Critique**: Point out something that could be better (-15 MANAGER_TRUST, "too soon")

---

#### Scene 6: The Cameron Read
**Location**: office

```
[Cameron stops by your desk]

CAMERON: [smiling]
"Hey! Settling in okay? Let me know if you need anything.
I was actually up for this role, but—"

[pause, waves hand]

"—anyway, water under the bridge.
I'm just glad we got someone good."

[They leave]

INNER VOICE:
"Water under the bridge."
That's not what their eyes said.

NARRATION:
Is Cameron a genuine ally or a threat waiting to happen?
```

**Choice 5**:
1. Take them at face value - they seem genuine (+5 NETWORK_STRENGTH, naive if wrong)
2. Stay cautious - friendly but guarded (+10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, FLAG: cameron_is_threat suspected)
3. Probe further - "That must have been disappointing" (Tests their response)
4. Avoid them - minimize interaction (-5 NETWORK_STRENGTH, might escalate tension)

---

### PART 2: MONTH ONE

#### Scene 7: The Predecessor Question
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Team meeting. Someone mentions "the old way Riley did things"]

TEAMMATE:
"Yeah, but Riley's gone for a reason."

[Awkward silence. Eyes flick to you.]

INNER VOICE:
Danger zone. Whatever you say about Riley defines you.

Praise them = you're aligned with failure
Criticize them = you're arrogant before you've proved anything
Distance yourself = safest, but don't overdo it

NARRATION:
How do you handle the Riley mention?
```

**Choice 6**:
1. **Neutral curiosity**: "I'd love to learn what worked and what didn't." (+10 REPUTATION, FLAG: avoided_predecessor_trap)
2. **Subtle distance**: "I'm focused on what we're doing now, not the past." (+5 REPUTATION, professional)
3. **Praise Riley**: "Sounds like they did good work." (-10 REPUTATION with some, they left for a reason)
4. **Critique Riley**: "I've already seen some things I'd do differently." (-15 REPUTATION, arrogant)

---

#### Scene 8: Finding Your First Win
**Location**: office (your desk)

```
NARRATION:
Week three. You need a win.
Not a big win. A visible win.

[You notice a small but annoying problem:]
The weekly report takes hours to compile manually.
Everyone hates it. No one has fixed it.

INNER VOICE:
Low-hanging fruit. Solve this, and you're the hero.

But how do you play it?
```

**Choice 7**:
1. **Fix it, share credit**: Solve it and present as team improvement (+10 EARLY_WINS, +15 REPUTATION, FLAG: delivered_early_win)
2. **Fix it, claim credit**: Solve it and make sure Victor knows YOU did it (+10 EARLY_WINS, +10 REPUTATION with leadership, -10 with peers)
3. **Suggest it, let others lead**: Raise the idea, offer to help (+5 REPUTATION, too passive for a win)
4. **Wait for a bigger opportunity**: This is too small (-5 EARLY_WINS, "missed the easy ones")

---

#### Scene 9: Morgan's Intel
**Location**: office-kitchen

```
[Coffee break. Morgan, the admin, is there.]

MORGAN: [casual, lowered voice]
"You're doing good so far. Keep your head down with Victor
until after the budget review."

[You must look confused]

MORGAN:
"Every year, he cuts someone's headcount after budget.
Don't stand out until that's over."

INNER VOICE:
Gold. This is the intel that keeps you alive.

MORGAN:
"Also—Cameron? Watch your back with that one."

[Morgan walks away with their coffee]

INNER VOICE:
The admin knows everything.
Always befriend the admin.
```

**Choice 8**:
1. Thank Morgan, remember everything (+20 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, FLAG: befriended_admin)
2. Ask more questions - who else to watch? (+15 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, +5 NETWORK_STRENGTH)
3. Brush it off - you can handle yourself (-10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS, ignoring good intel)

---

#### Scene 10: The Project Assignment
**Location**: meeting-room

```
HARPER:
"Good news. I'm putting you on the Mitchell account.
High visibility. Victor's watching this one."

INNER VOICE:
High visibility means high risk.
But also high reward.

HARPER:
"Cameron will be supporting. You'll lead."

[The dynamic just shifted. You're leading Cameron.]

INNER VOICE:
The person who wanted your job is now reporting to you.
This will go one of two ways.
```

**Choice 9**:
1. **Inclusive approach**: "I want Cameron's input—they know the history." (+10 NETWORK_STRENGTH, reduces threat)
2. **Clear leadership**: "Thanks. I'll set the direction and loop them in." (+5 MANAGER_TRUST, may antagonize Cameron)
3. **Defer to Cameron**: "Maybe Cameron should lead since they have more context?" (-20 MANAGER_TRUST, weak)
4. **Watch Cameron closely**: Keep them close, document everything (+10 POLITICAL_AWARENESS)

---

### PART 3: DAY 90

#### Scene 11: Victor's Attention
**Location**: office-hallway

```
[You're walking. Victor stops you.]

VICTOR: [neutral, evaluating]
"The Mitchell report. That was your work?"

YOU:
"Yes. With support from the team."

VICTOR:
"Harper was right about you."

[He nods and walks on]

INNER VOICE:
Two sentences. Massive impact.
Victor just told the floor he's watching you.

FLAG: impressed_victor
```

---

#### Scene 12: The Political Test
**Location**: meeting-room

```
[Department meeting. Two VPs disagree on direction.]

VP1:
"We should prioritize the Alpha project."

VP2:
"Beta has better ROI metrics."

[Harper looks at you]

HARPER:
"[Name], you've been on both. What's your take?"

INNER VOICE:
Oh no. They're asking you to take sides.
In front of everyone.

VP1 is Victor's ally.
VP2 is on the outs but has good points.

What do you do?
```

**Choice 10 - CRITICAL**:
1. **Side with VP1 (Victor's ally)**: "I think Alpha has strategic value..." (+15 REPUTATION with Victor's camp, -10 with VP2's)
2. **Side with VP2**: "The data supports Beta..." (+5 REPUTATION for honesty, -15 with power structure)
3. **Diplomatic both**: "Both have merit. What if we..." (+10 REPUTATION for nuance, might frustrate both)
4. **Defer**: "I don't have enough context to say." (-10 REPUTATION, looks weak)

---

#### Scene 13: The 90-Day Review
**Location**: meeting-room (Harper's office)

```
HARPER:
"Ninety days. Let's talk about how it's going."

[Harper has notes. Your future is in that folder.]

HARPER:
"Overall, I'm pleased. The Mitchell work was solid.
Victor mentioned you specifically."

[pause]

HARPER:
"Where do you see yourself in the next year?"

INNER VOICE:
This is the trajectory question.
What you say now sets their expectations.
```

**Choice 11**:
1. **Ambitious but team-focused**: "Growing here, taking on more responsibility, making the team stronger." (+15 MANAGER_TRUST, +10 REPUTATION)
2. **Clear ambition**: "I want to lead a major project within the year. I'm ready." (+10 MANAGER_TRUST, +5 if they see potential)
3. **Humble**: "Just want to keep learning and contributing." (-5 MANAGER_TRUST, too passive)
4. **Strategic alignment**: "I'd love your guidance on the best path here." (+10 MANAGER_TRUST, shows respect)

---

## Endings

### EXCELLENT OUTCOMES

**1. Rising Star**
**Trigger**: REPUTATION > 80, impressed_victor, delivered_early_win, allied with right people

```
NARRATION:
Ninety days. You've arrived.

Victor mentions you in leadership meetings.
Harper trusts you with the hard projects.
Your peers see you as someone going places.

INNER VOICE:
The first 90 days set the trajectory.
You set it upward.

LESSON:
First impressions don't just matter—they compound.
Get them right, and momentum does the rest.
```

---

**2. The Strategic Player**
**Trigger**: HIGH POLITICAL_AWARENESS, befriended_admin, mapped power structure

```
NARRATION:
You know things. Who's rising. Who's falling.
Where the real power flows.

When the next reorg happens—and it will—
you'll be ready.

INNER VOICE:
Everyone sees the org chart.
You see the actual map.

LESSON:
Information is power. The people who seem
"unimportant" often have the most of it.
```

---

### GOOD OUTCOMES

**3. Solid Foundation**
**Trigger**: REPUTATION 60-80, avoided major mistakes, some wins

```
NARRATION:
You're not a star yet. But you're not invisible.

Harper's happy. The team accepts you.
You've got a platform to build on.

INNER VOICE:
Not every first 90 days is a rocket launch.
Sometimes it's about not crashing.

LESSON:
Steady progress beats flashy mistakes.
You're positioned for year one.
```

---

**4. The Ally Network**
**Trigger**: HIGH NETWORK_STRENGTH, allied with Devon, befriended Morgan

```
NARRATION:
You might not have the flashiest wins.
But you have something better: people who will help you.

Devon tips you off before problems hit.
Morgan protects your calendar.
Even Cameron respects you.

INNER VOICE:
Projects come and go.
Relationships compound.

LESSON:
In corporate, you don't rise alone.
You rise with the people who pull you up.
```

---

### NEUTRAL OUTCOMES

**5. The Slow Burn**
**Trigger**: Moderate scores across the board, no major wins or fails

```
NARRATION:
Ninety days. You're... fine.
Not great, not terrible. Somewhere in the middle.

Harper's feedback: "Good start. Let's see what year one brings."

INNER VOICE:
You didn't fail. But you didn't ignite either.

The window for first impressions is closing.
Year one needs to be different.

LESSON:
"Fine" is the enemy of "great."
Don't get comfortable being invisible.
```

---

### BAD OUTCOMES

**6. The Overstepper**
**Trigger**: overstepped_early, criticized too soon, arrogant moves

```
NARRATION:
You tried to change too much, too fast.
Without earning the right to have an opinion.

Harper's feedback: "Talented. But needs to learn the culture."

Translation: Slow down or burn out.

INNER VOICE:
Confidence is good. Arrogance is fatal.
You came in too hot.

LESSON:
The first 90 days are for listening.
Not for revolutionizing.
```

---

**7. The Invisible One**
**Trigger**: stayed_too_quiet, no early wins, low REPUTATION

```
NARRATION:
Ninety days. You're not sure anyone remembers your name.

No wins. No enemies. No presence.

When layoffs come—and they always come—
invisible people go first.

INNER VOICE:
You played it too safe.
Safe is just slow failure.

LESSON:
Humility is good. Invisibility is death.
Speak up. Deliver something. Be seen.
```

---

**8. The Cameron Situation**
**Trigger**: cameron_is_threat, didn't manage it, Cameron undermined you

```
NARRATION:
Cameron smiled and nodded for 90 days.
And quietly made sure your wins looked like your failures.

Harper's feedback: "Some concerns about the Mitchell execution."

You know exactly where those "concerns" came from.

INNER VOICE:
You saw the threat. You didn't neutralize it.

Enemies don't announce themselves.
They just wait.

LESSON:
When someone wanted your job and didn't get it,
that's not "water under the bridge."
That's a timer.
```

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Backgrounds Needed
- office-lobby (day one arrival)
- office (general workspace, desk scenes)
- meeting-room (reviews, team meetings)
- office-cafeteria (lunch politics)
- office-kitchen (Morgan intel scene)

### Character Dynamics
```typescript
// Cameron threat level evolves
if (early_read_cautious && managed_cameron_well) {
  cameron_neutralized = true
} else {
  cameron_undermines_later = true
}

// Morgan relationship unlocks intel
if (befriended_admin) {
  unlock_hidden_information = true
}
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns

```typescript
// First introduction
"Brief background, excited to learn from the team, questions for them."

// Predecessor deflection
"I'm focused on what we're building now."

// Political navigation
"Both options have merit. What if we considered..."

// Win claiming (balanced)
"The team solved this together. I coordinated the approach."
```

### Week One
```
'Every face is forming an opinion. Before you've done anything.'

```

### Month One
```
'Low-hanging fruit. Solve it and you're the hero.'
'Whatever you say about your predecessor defines you.'
'"Water under the bridge" is never what it sounds like.'
```

### Day 90
```
'Two sentences from Victor. Massive impact.'
'They're asking you to take sides. In public.'
'First impressions don't just matter—they compound.'
```
