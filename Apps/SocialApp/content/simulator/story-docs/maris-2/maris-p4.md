Students pass it with hushed voices. Murmurs of the "Ted sketch," circulating through Xerox copies.

SCENE: CALDWELL ESTATE — HENRY

[Maris POV]

I hear his voice before I see him. Low, tempered, the kind of voice that carries power because it doesn’t have to raise itself. A family court judge, but always more

executioner than mediator. If Quinn is frost, Henry is fire, and together they cancel each other into mutual destruction.

Quinn tries to intercept him in the parlour. He doesn't stop walking.

"She had boys over," Quinn hisses.

He pauses. Just slightly. "And?"

"She was seen exiting a crisis centre with a man. There are Polaroids." Her voice is taut with pride. She's pleased to say it.

Henry raises an eyebrow. "Do you think she mailed them to herself, Quinn?"

A beat of silence. Then his eyes meet mine.

"Maris."

"Daddy."

He tilts his head, assessing. "Come upstairs."

We leave Quinn mid-sputter, Millie halfway down the stairs trying to eavesdrop. The moment the door closes behind us, the warmth fades.

"How bad is it?"

I hand him the flyer. Brenda. No last name. No future.

He reads it. Once. Twice. Sets it down.

"Did you send him?"

"I didn’t have to."

He nods. "Then it’s your mess to clean up."

"He’s unraveling."

"Then finish the job before he notices the string’s in your hand."

SCENE: TED’S APARTMENT — A FAMILY TAKEN

[Ted POV]

It starts small.

Louise offers Maris tea. She accepts. Maris compliments the doilies. Louise offers to make her more. Maris asks about Ted's baptism. Louise opens the photo album. Maris lingers around Molly, buying her gifts, showing her the number of ways she’s superior to her mother, as if she likes children and doesn’t see them as sticky parasites.

Then it spreads.

They speak without me. Maris jokes with my little brother about the toy cars on the shelf. She talks about how many sons she wants. She says she could never raise daughters because she’d feel too guilty if they were beautiful.

Louise laughs. Louder than she ever has for me.

Maris sits in my chair. She finishes my Tab. She tells Louise she thinks law school is noble. That "Ted has such a good heart." She stares at me while she talks, her lips staying slightly parted as though she’s inviting me to say something. I don’t. I wouldn’t know where to begin. There’s a flash of hot rage. Then she’ll reach over and innocently graze my thigh when my mother looks away.

My mother nods. Her eyes glisten while she takes in the lies of the nymphet I should’ve brutalised.

When I walk Maris out, I’m practically shaking. Rage. Hunger. I almost reach my hand under her skirt. Conservative for her. I guess she dresses appropriately for family.

"That was... something."

"She’s sweet," Maris says. "She likes me."

"She doesn’t even know you."

Maris tilts her head. "She doesn’t know you either."

Then she leans in. "I’m what she thinks you are."

I don’t sleep that night.

SCENE: CALDWELL PARLOUR — THE RECKONING

[Millie POV]

It’s the worst idea I’ve ever had.

But I do it.

I tell Quinn what I saw. The Polaroid in the hallway. The boy Maris brought in. The blood on her nails. I whisper it, at first. Then louder. Then clearer. I say her name without fear, despite it crystallising in the form of sweat beads trickling down my back.

Quinn listens. She folds the napkin on her lap and sets it down.

"Thank you, darling. That must have been hard."

Then Henry walks in. She stands. "Millie has something to tell you."

Millie does.

Henry listens. He doesn’t blink.

Then he walks over to the sideboard, pours himself two fingers of Glenlivet, and sits.

"If I hear another word about your sister to anyone outside this family, I’ll have you institutionalised."

Millie’s mouth opens. Closes.

"We have enough problems without adding yours."

Quinn says nothing.

Henry stands. Looks to me.

"Pack your things. You’re going to Salt Lake with your sister."

---

SCENE: TED'S APARTMENT — THE RETURN

[Ted POV]

She's in my kitchen. Maris is in my fucking kitchen. It feels like a mirage.

No warning. No knock. She’s in my fucking kitchen pouring Tab into a crystal tumbler like it’s scotch. Wearing my shirt.

"I let myself in," she says. "Hope that’s alright. Freda loves me.”

"How did you—?"

She holds up a key. My spare. Hidden under the loose tile.

"Freda told me where it was. It was raining, you see, and she didn’t want Ted’s girl to be soaking outside. You don’t mind, do you?" There’s the famous smile.

I’m too stunned to speak. She laughs.

"Relax. I haven’t stolen anything. Just your freedom, for now."

She walks past me. Drops the key in the sink. It clinks.

"Oh, and by the way," she says, pausing in the doorway. "I heard Utah law is the only one that accepted you. That's adorable. The only people who can tolerate you are Mormons. I wonder what Diane would think if she saw you now."

She leaves.

I can’t breathe. SCENE: LIZ’S APARTMENT — THE COLLAPSE

[Liz POV]

He’s distant.

He touches me like I’m dirty. Like he wants to scrub me out of his skin. I try to surprise him with dinner, but he’s already eaten. He doesn’t say what. I offer a backrub, he flinches.

Then I find the Polaroid.

Folded in his drawer. Her. Naked. Kneeling.

It’s not just the photo. It’s the note on the back.

"Wish you were here."

I don’t cry. I scream.

And when I tell Louise, she says:

"Maris is a lovely girl. Maybe you're just feeling insecure."

I throw up in the sink.

---

SCENE: STEPHEN — DISINTEGRATION

He finds the Polaroid before Maris says a word.

In the trash can by the rotary phone. It burns.

He can’t speak.

He sees her laugh with Ted. The way she touches his arm. The way Ted touches her lower back.

Stephen goes home and stands in front of the mirror.

He shaves his head. Then regrets it. Then smiles.

Because maybe this is what Maris wants. Maybe she wants to be terrified.

He takes the Polaroid and kisses the image.

Then sets it on fire.

---


SCENE: FALSE CALM — MARIS AND TED

[Maris POV]

Ted knocks. Polite. Like the last week didn’t happen.

I open the door wearing the softest thing I own: pale blue cashmere, thigh-grazing, no bra. He blinks like it hurts.

“You came.”

“You asked.”

“I wasn’t sure if you’d forgive me.”

“You didn’t do anything.”

He doesn’t realise that I’ve just weaponised his own line. That was his phrase, back when he left Liz bleeding and called it love.

He steps inside. I close the door behind him.

We sit on the velvet couch, feet almost touching. I pour him Darjeeling and spike it with honey. He stares at the sugar spoon like it’s sacred.

“I wanted to talk,” I say. “Before you go.”

He nods.

I place a hand on his thigh. “You’re going to do well.”

“You think so?”

“Utah will worship you, like Seattle should’ve.”

He looks unsure. He should be. Even the Mormons could rip him apart.

“They don’t know what you are,” I add gently. “They’ll think you're perfect.”

His eyes fill with something I almost mistake for gratitude. Or awe. Or hunger.

I take a bite of the lemon tart I’d made for him earlier. The crust cracks. The silence doesn’t.

“You’re not angry?” he asks finally.

“Why would I be angry?” I subdue the smile that’s attempt to form.

He exhales. His whole body slumps.

He thinks he’s won me again. That I’m going to waltz back into his life for good.


SCENE: GOING AWAY PARTY — THE PUBLIC HUMILIATION

[FIRST Person Limited: Ted POV]

It's just a gathering. That’s what she said when she invited me, Liz and Louise. Yes, my mother. The cheek of this little girl is driving me insane. They’re both embarrassing to be seen with. Liz in a frumpy little orange dress from the clearance rack. I flinched when I first saw it, recoiling with disgust. I couldn’t imagine why she would pick something like that. It’s not like she has a body worth showing off. The sag of her belly, the way her thighs crush together when she sits down, essentially a sack of potatoes wrapped in tapioca pudding. But surely, surely she could’ve picked better than this? She got in a real mood when I told her, as politely as I could, that she should change. She chose that moment to dig her heels in. My mother wears the same church dress the pastor is used to on every second Sunday of the month. She wore a hat. A hat indoors, at night. She thought it made her look fancy, but really it makes her look like she’s wandered out of a psychiatric facility. Molly was shrieking in my ear, begging to come because of how much she adores Maris. It took all of my restraint to hand her over to the sitter unharmed.

I step into the Carlyle ballroom. I feel it instantly. The bitterness of knowing people who are above you. The tension. The wealth. The way everything smells expensive, like leather and disdain. A string quartet is playing. There’s a roast pheasant tray. Someone in a Dior tuxedo. This is a party meant for me and I couldn’t even steal a tuxedo from Dior. Have I ever eaten pheasant? No. Have I tasted the flowing champagne? Only when in the company of people who’ll pick up the check. Liz is wilting on my arm. Louise’s eyes are wide with excitement. A world she’s never seen before and is unlikely to see again.

And there she is.

Maris. Wearing cream silk. Backless. Her hair curled just enough to seem effortless. A diamond tennis bracelet on one delicate wrist — not the one he gave her, something far meaner and colder. Something with many more zeroes on its price tag.

She leans in to greet someone tall. Broad. Blonde. With shoulders like a Roman statue and the jawline of a Kennedy.

Hunter Carlyle.

I go cold.

That’s him. That’s him.

The one who writes her letters. The one her family likes. The one she kissed in front of Quinn. The one in the engagement notice. The one she’s probably fucked.

Not probably. She has. He probably knows the ins and outs of her cunt better than she does. I was stupid to think otherwise. The humiliation stings.

And now he’s in a navy dinner jacket, glass of Bordeaux in hand, laughing with her like they’re already married. Guys like him get the Marises and Dianes of the world. I get left with Ramblers, Johnny, and Liz.

I stand by the hors d'oeuvres table like a schoolboy. I feel like I’m back at Woodrow Wilson. Slammed into a locker by the guy who got into varsity football while I barely made it off the bench. Too small. Too thin. Too weak. That was always the implication, even from my own family. But they were wrong. I was never weak. I just didn’t want to comply. I didn’t want anyone to answer to.

Hunter pats me on the back. “You the Utah guy?”

I nod. The Utah guy, is this son of a bitch being serious?

“Law school there, right? Brave.” Thumps me on the shoulder.

Brave. I want to punch him. Pummel him. Put him in the ground.

Maris comes over.

“Ted, this is Hunter. My oldest friend.”

Friend. A funny way to put it when the announcement of your engagement was in the newspaper for the world to see. The newspaper clipping that was put on my doorstep.

Hunter extends a hand like a prince, eyes glinting.

“Maris tells me you’re brilliant. I’ve heard all about the Centre.”

“She’s modest,” Maris says. “Never tells anyone how kind he is.”

I grip the glass so tightly my knuckles begin to throb. Liz is talking. Fawning more like, falling all over herself to soak in some of his cologne. Her eyes are bright, large. Her smile bigger than it ever is for me. He gives her the kind of attention one would a disabled dog. Kind. Putting her out of her misery with one gentle glide of his arm around Maris’s waist. Eighteen year old Maris with porcelain skin. Perfect teeth. A waist that cinches itself without the nylons Liz has to squeeze into. Legs that gleam and tits women pay for. Eyes that’d give you both an aneurysm and a hard on. A god pussy that can trick men into believing they’re the first to conquer it. Single mother Liz thinks she can compete. A mirthless laugh erupts from my chest against my will.

Hunter turns to Maris. “Shall we dance?”

“Of course.” She leans into him with ease. With comfort. With grace. She kisses me on the cheek before she goes. My skin starts to vibrate.

They disappear into the room.

I’m left with my expired girlfriend and my mother, who’s getting tipsy from the champagne. They’re both silent. I stand quietly, eavesdropping.

Someone mutters:

“Bet she’s glad that’s not the guy in the wanted poster.”

Laughter.

I don’t laugh.

---

SCENE: THE TURN

[Ted POV]

He can still feel her lips on his cheek when he gets into the car.

His hands shake. His jaw is clenched so tight he might shatter a molar.

She let him in. Then showed him the door. She dressed like a virgin. Then kissed him like an elderly relative. She gave him tea. Then threw him to the wolves in designer tuxedos, all mocking him behind their smug grins.

She brought Hunter.

She fucking knew how much that would hurt.

He starts the engine. The seatbelt buckle is viscous with sweat. His palms won't stop twitching.

He drops off the dead weight of two the women in his life. One a mess in orange. The other with a smile on her face from a full flute of champagne and false promises of lunch dates with Quinn.

He drives back to Bellevue.

To her house.

To watch while Hunter defiles her. To go back to a time where he didn’t care about what happened to Maris and by who.




SCENE: THE INVITATION

[Maris POV]

I’m not surprised when he calls my private extension. I watched him sulking with Liz in that horrendous orange sack she was calling a dress. Her hair was up in sad little curls – intent to be Marilyn, the execution? Mrs Rogers’ poodle. Hunter and I laughed so hard. Our first bonding experience in years.

I’m surprised Ted waits until midnight. I expected him to screech to the closest payphone.

“Maris. Can we talk?” he asks, voice low. “In person. Just once more. I won’t try anything.”

“That’s what you said last time.”

Silence.

“There's a cabin,” he adds. “Just off Lake Sammamish. No one’s there right now. I used to go there to study. It’s safe.”

Safe.

That word again.

“Why there?” I ask.

“It’s quiet. I just need to explain. Please, Maris.”

There’s a pause. Not long enough to seem cautious. Just long enough to sting.

“I’ll come if you don’t touch me,” I say. “I know how those hands work.”

“I won’t.”

He says it like a promise. I hear it like a classic Bundy lie. I don’t blame him. I looked phenomenal in that dress. Of course he wants another taste. Maybe if he is sad enough, I’ll allow it. Being rejected from UW is a level of humiliation that requires the warmest of comfort. Not a hotdog down a hallway. I giggle as I get into the Carrera.



SCENE: THE INVITATION

[Maris POV]

The phone rings. I let it.

On the fourth try, I answer.

He doesn’t say my name. Doesn’t breathe heavy. Just: “There’s a place I want to show you.”

I almost hang up.

“It’s not like that,” he says quickly. “It’s… somewhere I go when I need to think. By the lake. I’ve never brought anyone there before.”

I say nothing.

He’s quiet. Waiting.

“Come alone,” he adds. “Just for a few minutes. I—I just want to explain things properly before I leave.”

There’s something in his voice I’ve never heard before.

Not rage. Not lust.

Hesitation. Maybe shame.

And against my better judgement — or maybe because of it — I say yes.

---

SCENE: THE CABIN

[Ted and Maris — alternating POVs]

It’s tucked beneath Douglas firs, hidden near the edge of Lake Sammamish. Not a real cabin — more of a ranger’s shack with cheap insulation and no plumbing. The kind of place you only find if you know where to look. No one seems to be looking for it currently, not with the state it’s in. I let out a subdued groan. My Ferragamo shoes are brand new and the floor looks questionable.

It smells like old smoke and mildew. Dust blooms when I step inside.

He’s already there. Two mismatched chairs. A flask. One lantern. There are hollows beneath his yes that weren’t there a few hours ago.

“Romantic,” I say, brushing a cobweb from the doorframe. I’m glad I left the Kelly in the car.

He doesn’t smile. For once, I can’t read his face.

He motions to the chair.

I sit. It creaks under me.

“You wanted to talk,” I remind him. My eyes dart around the room, looking for windows and doors. The only door is the one I came in through.

He nods. Drinks. Doesn’t pass it to me.

“You made me feel like I mattered,” he says finally.

I raise an eyebrow. “That was your first mistake. You believed me. It was an obvious lie; you of all people should know what those are.”

He flinches. Just a blink.

“You made me feel like I had control,” he tries again. “And then you, you, you—”

“Then I reminded you who you are.”

He stands. Paces. Breathes too hard. His nostrils flare and he speaks in a voice that’s almost foreign to me.

“You don’t know who I am.”

“I know what you are.”

I shouldn’t have said that. I really, really shouldn’t have said that. The dread comes immediately.

He turns.

“What am I, Maris?”

“Predictable.” I bite my lip to stop talking. My heart flutters rapidly in my chest. I feel the chill on my skin.

He lunges.

The chair crashes backward. My shoulder hits the floor. My skull hits the beam.

Lights out for a second. Long enough. The pain is sharp, coming in jolts before engulfing me whole.

He’s on me. Eyes oddly calm. His face more serene than I’ve ever seen. He’s been drinking, but he’s not drunk. I smell the cologne on him, the marijuana he must’ve smoked in the car on the way over; I didn’t see a joint anywhere.

His hands are everywhere. My face, my thighs, my chest. He parts my legs with his knee. The crack of my head against the headboard, this time deliberate. His first smile. His face is less than an inch away from me. I will myself not to scream, not to beg, not

to cry. He hikes up my dress and rips my underwear clean into two pieces. I hear the fabric pulling apart through the gurgling in my ear. He pauses, his hand on my cheek, gentle, almost sweet. In less than the flicker of an eyelash, he pushes into me with animalistic force, searing me inside with each thrust. None of the tenderness he used in my bedroom. Just rage, lust, hunger. Blackness. Every fibre of me is shrieking, but I don’t give him the satisfaction of allowing it to escape my lips. His hand finds my neck and my vision swims as he pushes down. His lips are on mine. I try to say his name, but nothing comes out. Tears begin to well despite my wilful defiance. My hair is in his fist, yanked straight from my scalp.

I claw at him. Nails rake his cheek. He doesn’t stop. I smell the copper, taste blood. My own. His. It’s streaming from my nose. He kisses me and it dries around his lips. I close my eyes, squeezing them tight. He’s heavier than he looks. He pins my arms above me with one hand.

“Say it,” he snarls. “Say what I am. LOOK AT ME.” The words come with a slap.

His mouth clamps onto my chest above my left breast. His bite digs through flesh.

I scream.

He doesn’t stop. Teeth grind. I taste iron.

He punches my temple. The sound is wet. His fingers find my mouth, wrenching it apart. He’s breathing heavy. He replaces the fingers with himself, and I struggle for oxygen. He tells me again to open my eyes. When I don’t, something slams against my forehead.

I go still.

He pants. Shaking. Spits on the floor.

“You think you’re so cold,” he mutters. “So superior.”

I open my eyes. Everything is spinning.

“I still am,” I whisper. “You know you can’t kill me, Ted.”

That’s when he grabs the lantern. Throws it. It shatters against the wall.

Flame hisses. Not enough to burn. Just light.

I pull myself to my feet, one shoulder screaming. One shoe missing.

Maris’s Dissociated POV (The Hallucination): I stand. I walk, not on legs that ache, but on something lighter, as if I’ve grown wings from the rot.

In this version of the night, there is no blood. There is no man. There is just a white-tiled bathroom.

A mirror that doesn’t show my reflection. I take the towel — plush, monogrammed — and wipe down the insides of my thighs like I’m preparing for dinner. Like it’s an evening at Canlis, not a crime scene in the woods. I dab at the corner of my mouth. I touch up my mascara. I hum a French lullaby I can’t quite place.

The world steadies. My voice returns. I walk out the door.

---

Back to Reality Cue: But the real Maris doesn’t move. She’s unconscious in the dirt. Blood in her mouth, teeth loose, bite mark raw across her chest. When Henry finds her — it’s hours later — she hasn’t spoken a word.


TED’S POV – CABIN IN THE WOODS There’s going to be no mercy for her tonight. I’ve been waiting for this since January. The urges only grew with her submission that night. Her taunts. Her invasion into my sanctuaries. Her smug superiority while sending the Polaroids, leaving trophies in my room. Humiliating me in public. Treating me like I was beneath her. Involving Liz, involving my fucking mother. I hear the engine of her Porsche as it careens into a flat part of the land outside the cabin. The rest is forestry. Not a soul nearby. Nobody for miles. She walks in with the same haughtiness, the same smile as the rest of them, the trademark of the female. When they’re condescending, controlling or emasculating you, forcing their opinions on you, bugging you for a ring, begging for their lives. The cream silk dress is gone. In its place, a miniskirt and a blouse. Her hair is up. She starts to talk like she’s going to control what happens here. Commenting on the lack of romance. I tell her to sit. She does. I take a sip of the whisky I stole from her house. I don’t offer her any. I want her to feel everything I’m about to do to her.

She’s nervous. I can almost smell it on her bared flesh. When she tells me I’m predictable, I lose it.

I throw her to the floor. The sound of her head smacking against the beam before her going silent gives me an unparalleled sense of satisfaction. My breath is laboured. Rage, excitement, hunger. All at once. She doesn’t get to tell me what to do. How to

manoeuvre her. How to pleasure her. Her pleasure doesn’t matter now. I gave her a chance.

No. I gave her many chances. She thought she was above me.

“Take off your clothes.” It’s a command. Not a question.

She blinks a few times, confused. “No.”

“Do you want me to hurt you, Maris?” I lean over her, let her feel my breath on her skin. Let her look up at me. She’s nothing here. Nobody. Less than me.

“You wouldn’t.” Her words are laggy, her quick wit stolen.

I strike her across the face. Hard. “Are you sure about that?”

The feral panic in her eyes doesn’t lead to her obedience. The bitch has the nerve to smile. I can see it in the corners of her mouth. She nods.

This time, my fist is closed. I gave her the opportunity. She refused to take it.

Thwack. Her back against the wood.

I wait patiently for her to rouse. Maybe I’ve knocked some sense into her. Maybe she’ll learn how to play to make it out of here. She really thinks she’s special, and it’s time to show her how wrong she is. They all bleed the same.

She comes to. Tries to speak. The last thing I want to hear is her lilted, prissy, condescending voice. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of these things. These whores. In this cabin, I’m God himself.

I want her mouth operating on my terms.

The same mouth that called me predictable. That asked if I was man enough.

I press her down again. Fingers tangled in her hair. Her jaw tight.

“Open.”

She shakes her head, presses her pretty little lips together like a mute. She’s bleeding from the temple. “Don’t make me do this, Maris. Open your fucking mouth,” I hiss.

She refuses.

Again.

She leaves me no choice. It’s as though she wants me to do it myself. These women are so fucking stupid. I use my fingers to pry it wide. Ready for me.

This isn’t about a good time. It’s about control. It’s about turning the part of her that tried to wound me into something that serves.

She coughs. Chokes. Her eyes flood, mascara bleeding as I push in all the way. But she doesn’t cry. Not even when she gets me instead of oxygen.

Even now — she refuses to give me that.

That’s fine. I’ll take everything else. I’ll leave her with nothing. Humiliated. Broken. Finally quiet.

I sit back, watching her once the first wind is complete. Mouth bruised. Face flushed. She still doesn’t cry. Not even a twitch. She swallows. Not because she wants to — because there’s nowhere else for it to go.

Good girl. Finally using the manners from her mansion on the hill.

I light a cigarette. The one I stole from her glove compartment. Take a long drag. Let the smoke fill the silence. My body’s not ready yet. Not quite. But it will be. It always comes back.

The second wave is better anyway. Less messy. More mine.

She shifts slightly. Probably thinks it’s over. I smile. It’s not.

She’s quiet again. The kind of quiet that feels like consent, even when it isn’t. She’s limp. Disoriented. Bleeding from the mouth, the shoulder, maybe somewhere else. I don’t care. The blouse is torn. The skirt’s askew. She looks less like a goddess now. More like the others. Finally.

I crouch. Study her face again. She doesn’t blink. Good.

That night in her estate — I touched her like a man who worshipped. Let her moan, let her finish. First time she ever had. Her virginity claim was backed up with genuine shock. She thought that made her special. She’s not.

I don’t touch her with my mouth. I’m not here to worship. I look. That’s enough. She doesn’t deserve more.

Her legs part, not from willingness, but gravity. And that’s when it comes back — the second wind. The urge. The ownership. The need to make her mine. Not gently. Not even savagely. Just completely.

A violent thrust. Then two. Then four. Not even for sensation. Each one feels like victory. It’s for the principle. I don’t need her arousal. I don’t need her love. I need her to remember.

I don’t flip her over. I don’t use the other hole. I try, but my body stops me. My hands are steady, but my mind refuses. That’s for the gutter girls. The Brendas of the world. The compliant Lizes. N

hand and study her as she trembles, as her thighs are pushed further away from each other. As the blood trickles from the cunt I worshipped.

“Ted.” It’s all she says.

I strike her again. The memories flood my brain. The Polaroids of her gagged and bound. Her on her knees, looking up with control. I laugh. The proud woman is now a whimpering little girl.

When she slaps me, something explodes in my chest. I sink my teeth into her flesh, just above those too high tits. It works. This time she screams.

She still doesn’t cry. Not when I press deeper. Not when I split her open like she’s nothing. Not even when I bite down hard enough to bruise.

It infuriates me.

What is she made of?

They always cry. Even Diane cried. Even Liz. Eventually.

But not her.

She just stares — that blank, vacant gaze. No tears. No begging. Like she’s already somewhere else.

She’s supposed to scream. Break. Submit.

Instead, she’s gone — vanished into her own mind.

I hit her again, just to see if I can bring her back.

Nothing.

It's not victory anymore. It's theft. She's stolen my moment.


SCENE: PRIVATE HOSPITAL — BELLEVUE, LATE JULY 1974 Maris Caldwell — First Person

---

The ceiling is cream. Not white — cream. I know the difference.

I blink slowly. The pain comes second.

My mouth is dry. My ribs sting. Something aches deep in my thighs. There’s a phantom pressure on my chest, like someone’s still holding me down. But no — I’m alone. Wrapped in white cotton sheets with a faint gold embroidery on the edges.

The scent of lavender hangs in the air, too artificial to be floral, too faint to be cloying. Hermes blanket at the foot of the bed. A tray of tea I didn't ask for sits untouched on a lacquered side table. Everything here screams of discretion. Of money.

I glance at the mirror across from the bed.

My face looks… wrong.

The left side is swollen. There's a bruise flowering just under the eye. My lip is split. A gauze dressing spans the upper part of my chest. I already know what’s under it. He bit me. Left a mark. Like a fucking dog.

There's a nurse nearby, young, pretty, in designer sneakers.

She notices I’m awake.

“Oh—Miss Caldwell. You’re awake. How are you feeling?”

I say nothing.

She flutters closer, smiling too much. “Your father arranged everything. You’ve been here two nights. The doctor said you might have some—um—temporary disorientation. That’s normal. Your CT came back clear, which is wonderful.”

I look down. There’s an IV in my arm and a silk ribbon tied loosely around my wrist. Not hospital issue. It’s Dior.

“Where am I?”

“Private wing of St. Cecilia’s,” she says. “Technically the Caldwell suite. No one’s allowed in unless authorised.”

“Where’s Millie?”

Her face falters. “I’m afraid—your father left strict instructions.”

I almost laugh. Of course he did.

---

Later, the doctor comes. Balding. Dignified. Calls me “Miss Caldwell” with a trembling reverence usually reserved for heiresses and film stars.

He never says the word “assault.”

Instead: “There was some bruising consistent with blunt trauma,” and “the superficial injuries have been dressed.” He doesn’t ask who did it. He doesn’t have to.

That’s the point of being a Caldwell. The privilege to suffer in silence, in satin sheets, with your abuser’s name quietly deleted from the ledger.

---

That night, Henry arrives.

He doesn’t knock. He doesn’t look at the bruises.

He pours himself a scotch from the minibar. Sits at the foot of the bed. His eyes are slate. Calm.

“Your mother thinks you fell on the slopes,” he says.

I don’t answer.

He swirls the glass, then glances at me. “I could have killed him.”

“I know.”

“I still might.”

A beat.

Then: “Thank you.”

He snorts. “Thank me when he’s in a grave and you’re the one who put him there.”

---

The room falls quiet. Only the hum of machinery, the gentle clink of ice in crystal.

Henry finishes the scotch and stands.

“You’ll leave Seattle by week’s end,” he says. “I’ve arranged a suite in Aspen. The Van de Graafs are hosting a fundraiser. It’s time you met Charles.”

I don’t move. Don’t nod.

“Rest. You’ll need it.”

He leaves without a backward glance.

---

The moment the door closes, I turn toward the mirror.

I pull down the gauze. The teeth marks are livid, crescented. Bruises bloom in violet and rust.

I tilt my head.

For a second, I don’t see myself.

And then I do.

My reflection is calm. Smiling faintly.

“Next time,” I whisper to her, “he bleeds.”


SCENE: CALDWELL ESTATE — MILLIE & QUINN — LATE JULY 1974 Third Person — Omniscient POV

Quinn Caldwell has not left her dressing room in thirty-six hours.

The door remains shut. The housekeepers are warned with clipped tones and flared nostrils that any knock on it will result in termination. Behind it, the scent of tuberose, gin, and Guerlain face cream hangs like rot.

She hasn’t cried.

Millie has. In the hallway, in the powder room, into the shoulder of the pale-blue cardigan she wore to visit Maris at the hospital. She wasn’t allowed in. She wasn’t even acknowledged.

The nurse said her name wasn’t on the list.

But she knew. The gauze on Maris’s collarbone. The nurse's darting eyes. The way Quinn returned from St. Cecilia’s wearing sunglasses indoors.

Something happened.

Something bad.

And it didn’t happen to Millie.

Which meant that for the first time in twenty years, Quinn had no interest in her.

She sits on the ottoman outside her mother’s door, knees tucked up beneath her chin, the same way she used to sit when she was seven and afraid of thunderstorms. Only this time, her palms are dry. She isn't scared. Just irrelevant.

She tries to knock. Stops herself.

She tries to call Hunter. No answer.

She considers calling him. The one Maris warned her about. But her fingers hover over the dial.

Because maybe Maris deserved it.

Maybe she finally pushed too far.

She presses her forehead to the door.

"Mommy?"

Nothing.

She slides to the floor and stays there.

---

SCENE: VOLUNTEER OFFICE — SEATTLE, NIGHT Ted Bundy — Third Person, Deep Limited POV

Ted’s hands won’t stop shaking.

He fumbles with the pamphlets on the desk. The stack won’t stay straight. The corner catches his finger. A shallow paper cut opens. He sucks at it, bitter copper against the back of his tongue.

He’s been having dreams again. Not nightmares. Replays.

Her mouth. The blood. The quiet.

It should have been enough. But it wasn't. Not really.

Because she lived.

And worse—

She didn’t cry.

He slams the drawer shut, breath shallow.

She could destroy him. If she speaks—if her father speaks—

The Caldwells have power. Money. Hotels. Lawyers. Entire firms.

And he left her alive.

He runs a hand through his hair. It’s damp.

He needs to disappear.

He packs everything that night. The contents of the bug. The box beneath the bed. The trophy hidden under the floorboard in the apartment. The photos.

He goes to Liz’s place. Tells her it’s over. Blames stress, blames the hotline, blames her.

She screams. Throws something.

He leaves before she can stop him.

Two days later, he boards a flight to Salt Lake City.

---

SCENE: SEA-TAC AIRPORT PARKING LOT — NIGHT Third Person — Ominous Omniscient

Ted doesn’t see him until it’s too late.

He’s loading his luggage into the Beetle. The night is cold. Fog skirts the edge of the tarmac. There’s a flicker of motion behind him. A scent. Something rich. Familiar.

He turns.

Henry Caldwell leans against the next car over, smoking.

“Going somewhere, son?”

Ted freezes.

Henry exhales. The smoke coils like a threat.

“You touched something that didn’t belong to you,” he says.

Ted’s lips part.

Henry doesn’t wait. “Seattle’s small. Utah's bigger. Make sure it's far enough. Because if she so much as bruises again, they won't find your body.”

He flicks the cigarette. It arcs. Lands near Ted’s shoes.

Then he gets into his car. Drives off.

Ted doesn’t breathe until the red taillights disappear.


SCENE: THE MOTHERS WE CHOOSE TO KILL FIRST

Millie’s POV – August 1974

The hydrangeas have wilted. They don’t die with grace — they turn brown at the edges like rotting paper, collapsing inward like they know they’ve failed.

Millie sits at the kitchen table, still in last night’s clothes. Her mascara’s smudged, one contact dry and blurry. Her wrists ache — not from anything dramatic, just too much scrubbing. The bathroom tiles wouldn’t come clean. She used bleach and an old toothbrush until the skin on her knuckles cracked.

Quinn walks in like it’s a normal morning. Hair pinned back. Ivory silk Halston blouse. Thin belt, gold hardware. She shoots Millie a look of disdain at the sight of her hands. “Millicent, please, for the love of God, do something about that. Manicures are worth the money to not look like the help.”

Millie grips her mug tighter.

“I need to talk to you,” she says.

Quinn doesn't glance over. “Is it about the emergency tweezers you took from my drawer? I’ve told you before, darling—thinner brows don’t suit you.”

“It’s not about the hair on my face..”

A beat. Quinn allows Lupe to pour her coffee. No sugar, no cream. No calories.

Millie exhales. “I’m scared of her.”

Still no eye contact.

“She’s—different. You see it too. You’ve always seen it. The way she talks. The way she looks at people. It’s like she’s—”

“She’s your sister.”

“She’s a murderer.”

Quinn sips. Then, without inflection: “So you’ve said.” She pulls Millie in by the arm, gesturing towards the maid who’s pretending not to listen. “And you should be glad this one doesn’t speak English.”

“I’m not making it up. I found something. In the greenhouse. There was blood on the—”

“You found a spider and fainted.”

“Mother—”

“You’ve always had a flare for melodrama, Millie. The tears, the fainting, the wrists. It’s exhausting. Do you remember your aunt Cecilia, the one with all the accusations and crazy stories?”

Millie stares at her. She shakes her head.

“Neither does anyone else. Your father put her in the nuthouse ten years ago. If you don’t stop it with your inane jibber-jabber, I’ll help him with the intake paperwork for you.” “Mother, I’m – I’m trying to protect us.” Millie’s upper lip trembles.

“No. You’re trying to matter.” Quinn turns then. Her gaze is dead calm, surgical. “You’ve always hated how special she is.”

Millie’s throat closes.

“Special?” she croaks. “She killed someone.”

“And if that were true — what do you think happens next? The police barge in, the press swarm the gates, and the Caldwell name is dragged through the mud? Is that what you want?”

“I want to feel safe.”

Quinn sets her cup down. Walks closer. The perfume hits first — Chanel No. 19, sharp as ammonia.

“You want to feel important. You always have. That’s why you flirt with her boyfriends. Why you dress like her. Why you’re always conveniently near when she’s gone.”

“I—”

“You want to be her so badly you’d destroy her to do it.”

Millie flinches. Her chest tightens. The tears arrive too fast — too familiar. Quinn’s face doesn’t change. There’s no softness, no maternal instinct. Just calculation.

“You think Henry doesn’t see through you?” she continues. “You think I don’t? If you weren’t so sad, it might be impressive.”

“I hate you,” Millie whispers.

“No,” Quinn replies. “You hate that I won’t let you whinge while your sister recovers from a brutal attack perpetrated by a man you tried to take from her.”

Silence.

Millie swallows, staring at the floor. Then:

“If anything happens to me… it’ll be your fault.”

Quinn smiles. Just barely.

“And if anything happens to her—” She leans in close, voice clipped, cold. “I’ll say it was you.”


SCENE: THE GOLDEN BOY NEVER AGED

Maris’s POV

I hear him before I see him when I get home. Hunter’s laugh — full of golden promise and nothing underneath — echoes off the stairwell like a threat. He’s always had that voice. The kind that makes schoolgirls etch new surnames for themselves in their notebooks and matrons forget their marriages. The kind that makes you feel chosen, until the nausea sets in.

He’s standing in the library with Quinn when I enter. His shirt is rolled to the elbows, collar open just enough to pretend he doesn’t know how obnoxious he is. There’s a fresh tan across his cheekbones and a Chanel-logo cufflink gleaming where it doesn’t belong.

“Darling,” he says, as though we’ve spoken this month.

I kiss his cheek like I’m forgiving a dog for chewing through my favourite shoes.

“You’re back early,” I say. My voice nearly trembles from the effort of holding back revulsion.

He shrugs. “Got bored in Acapulco. Jack was more interested in tanning oils than tequila, if you catch my drift.”

Quinn laughs politely. She’s wearing her blue Dior — the one that gives the illusion of youth from a distance but looks like mourning up close. Her pearls are real. Her convictions aren’t.

“I was just telling your mother,” Hunter continues, “about that summer on the boat. You remember, Maris? When you were twelve and you had that little green dress—”

The room goes still.

Quinn doesn’t blink. Neither do I.

“I remember,” I say. Calm. Controlled.

Hunter grins. “You kept trying to swim out farther than the rest of us. Thought you were invincible.”

“Wasn’t I?”

“Still are,” he says, voice softer now. “You’ve always had that... strength.”

I walk toward him slowly, the way one might approach a viper basking in the sun.

“Funny, isn’t it?” I say, voice low. “You’ve still got the taste of twelve. No, wait. I was 12. You were 15. You decided I was ready when I told you I wasn’t.”

The air sucks out of the room. Quinn’s teacup halts midair.

Hunter laughs — too loud, too late. “You always were wicked.”

I step closer, toe to toe, and place a hand on his chest. Think about digging my teeth into his neck, Bundy style. Let Hunter have a matching chunk of flesh missing.

“I meant what I said, sweetheart.” My smile is planned to perfection. “And I know you remember every second.”

Quinn sets down her cup, porcelain clinking against the saucer.

I turn toward her. “You didn’t stop it then. I don’t expect you to now.”

She opens her mouth — but nothing comes out.

I touch her shoulder as I pass. Not a threat. A benediction.


SCENE: MILLIE’S GAMBIT

Millie’s POV — That Evening

The air in her room feels wrong. Too cold, too still — like a dollhouse no one plays with anymore.

Millie closes the door and presses her back to it. She exhales. Once. Then again. Not to calm herself — just to hear something alive in the silence.

She sits at her vanity. Her fingers tremble as she opens the top drawer. Inside: a half-used tube of lipstick Maris once threw at her, a broken hair clip, and the little vial of perfume she stole from Quinn's travel case. Cabochard. Too sharp for her, but it smells like control.

She applies the lipstick. Crooked. Smears. Tries again.

Then she leans forward, eyes wide.

“I’m not crazy,” she whispers to her reflection.

The girl in the mirror doesn’t look convinced.

She opens her diary — the one she hides in her pillowcase. Flips to a blank page. Begins writing.

If anything happens to me… it was Maris. If I disappear, if I’m hurt, if I’m gone — look at her first.

She hesitates. Then crosses it out. Not strong enough.

She tries again.

She kills things. She always has. The birds when we were six, the boy from the greenhouse. She knows how to smile while you’re bleeding.

Still not right. Too poetic. The police don’t believe poetry.

She grabs a different sheet. Starts scribbling in Stephen’s handwriting — blocky, uneven. She practised it once for a prank that never landed. Now she traces it, line by line.

Saw her dragging something heavy. She told me to forget it. There was blood. I’m scared.

She stares at it. Then folds it. Seals it in an envelope. Writes on the front: To be opened in case of emergency.

Her hands shake. She needs something more.

She looks to Maris’s room. The door is slightly ajar. Unusual. Dangerous.

She enters.

The light hits differently in here. Cooler. Sterile. There’s a faint scent of Tom Ford and violets — precise, curated, horrifying.

She rifles through drawers quickly but quietly.

Nothing.

Then, in the vanity drawer — under silk scarves and matchbooks from Canlis — she finds it.

A Polaroid.

A girl. Barely dressed. On her knees. A man’s shoe in the corner. A date scrawled on the back. No name.

Millie doesn’t know who she is. But she knows this is proof. She doesn’t care if it isn’t.

She tucks the photo into her bra.

She’ll take it to the police again. And this time she won’t cry. This time, she’ll act like Maris.

No tears. No trembling.

Just power.


SCENE: THE WORLD IS WATCHING

Ted’s POV — July 1974

The news is always on now.

Even when the TV’s muted, he watches the ticker crawl like it’s coded just for him. Missing. Disappeared. Woman last seen. Lake Sammamish. Flame Tavern. He reads it all like scripture — searching for his name in the subtext.

He changes clothes three times a day. Shaves twice. Keeps the blinds drawn except when he's waiting for something. Or someone. Which is always.

The first envelope arrived three days ago. Plain. White. No stamp. No return address. Just slid under the windshield wiper of his car like a threat from God.

Inside: A Nancy comic. Dated November 24, 1946. His birthday.

A small circle drawn in pencil around one panel — Nancy looking directly at the reader, hands on her hips. A speech bubble added by hand:

“Do you know who your Daddy is, Teddy?”

His heart stuttered. He vomited in the sink. Liz knocked on the bathroom door for forty minutes.

He burned the comic. Then kept the ashes in a matchbox. He doesn’t know why.

He smashed a mirror after reading that one. Liz didn’t bother questioning him.

---

SCENE: THE LAST WOMAN STANDING

Liz’s Apartment — That Evening

She’s watching the news again. The Lake Sammamish story is looping. Two girls. Still missing.

“You know one of them was named Carol?” she says, eyes fixed on the screen. “Isn’t that Maris’s friend? You mentioned her.”

Ted freezes.

“No,” he lies. “Different person.”

She turns toward him. “You’ve been acting weird. Distant. You’re never home, and when you are, you just sit in the dark like some—some ghost.”

He doesn’t answer.

Liz steps closer, desperate now. “Ted… what’s happening to you?”

He laughs. A sharp, joyless sound.

“Why? You jealous I’m not on top of you every night anymore?”

She flinches. His mouth keeps going.

“You want it? Huh? Want me to fuck you like I did when I thought you mattered?”

“Ted—”

“You think you’re better than the girls on TV because you’re still alive? You think that means anything to me?”

She slaps him.

He smiles. Slow, like he enjoys it.

“You hit like a mother.”

She stares at him, horrified. “I used to love you.”

“I never asked you to.”

He walks out. The door slams behind him like a gunshot, and Liz jumps.

---

SCENE: POLAROID OF THE CLONE

Ted’s POV — Late Night

He finds the envelope tucked into the mailbox. Again — no name. No writing on the outside.

Inside: A Polaroid. Taken through the window of a diner.

Stephen. Brown hair slicked like his. A tan jacket, just like the one Ted wore to the Crisis Centre last fall. Same patent shoes. Same narrow frame. He’s mid-bite in the photo, smiling at the waitress. There’s ketchup on his napkin. A paperback copy of Crime and Punishment on the table beside him.

On the back, in Maris’s slanted, cruel script:

“You inspired him. He even walks like you now. I wonder who they’ll arrest first.”

Ted’s knees buckle. He sits on the porch. Chest tight. Eyes darting. Looking around — but there’s no one.

The mailman? A neighbour? Her?

He clutches the Polaroid like it’s evidence in his own trial.

“They’ll arrest him,” he mutters. “They’ll see. He’s not me. He’s not me. He’s not me.”

He rocks for hours. Doesn’t notice the sun come up.


Ted’s POV — Night

The second envelope arrives two nights after the Nancy comic. Same white paper. Same lack of fingerprints. It’s heavier this time.

He opens it slowly.

Inside: A newspaper clipping from the 1950s —

“ELIZABETH LUND HOME FOR UNWED MOTHERS: A Safe Haven for Girls in Crisis” An old photo of the home accompanies the article: brick building, white trim, a nun standing proudly on the front steps.

One paragraph is underlined in thick, steady ink:

“Many of the children born here never know who their fathers are. In certain cases, the girls were victims of incest, rape, or predation within the family.”

Beneath it, in Maris’s slanted hand:

“All in the family. Samuel… father and grandfather at once. Impressive.”

Ted’s breath catches. His throat tightens.

There’s a pressed flower inside too — brittle, brown-edged. A violet. The same kind planted beside the Caldwell greenhouse.

He tears the envelope with his teeth. Dumps the pieces into the garbage disposal.

The smell won’t leave.

He can’t scrub it off his hands.

He dreams of his grandfather that night — standing in a doorway, saying nothing. Just smiling, eyes too bright, like a man who knows exactly what he’s done and that no one will ever stop him.


SCENE: “THAT’S NOT MY NAME”

Stephen’s POV – August 1974

The tan jacket hangs just right now. He’s finally found the one with the same stitching — two buttons, notched lapel. Same shade of caramel Ted wore the night Maris first touched his arm. He remembers that moment. He wasn’t even in the room. But he remembers.

The shoes shine. He keeps them polished every night. Patent leather. Brown. The ones Ted wore to the Flame.

He’s changed his part. Switched cologne. Slowed his voice to match the rhythm — the measured cadence Ted uses when he’s explaining something important. He practices in front of the mirror.

“I know what I’m doing.” “I’m not like them.” “You think I’m the bad guy?”

He says it until it sounds like someone else. Until it doesn’t feel like Stephen anymore.

---

The Crisis Centre smells like sweat and mildew now. Maris isn’t here tonight, but that’s okay. He doesn’t need her approval. She’s already chosen him. She gave him a second glance. She noticed the haircut. She called it cleaner.

He clutches the notepad like an author holding his completed manuscript. Writes her name over and over again in the margins.

Maris. Maris Caldwell. Maris C.

He even tried writing Theodore Bundy once. It felt… right.

---

The payphone rings when he’s clocking out. He jumps, heart hammering. Lifts the receiver like it might shock him.

“Hello?”

A beat.

“Oh, sweetheart! It’s Mom!”

He blinks.

“I’ve been trying to reach you all week! You’re never home. I was worried, Stephen—”

He stiffens.

“Don’t call me that.”

“What?”

“That’s not my name.”

Silence.

“You sound strange, sweetheart. Are you sick? Should I come up to Seattle? Your Aunt Debby could drive—”

“Stop calling me that,” he hisses. “That’s not who I am. That’s not who I—”

“Stephen—”

“SHUT UP. MY NAME IS TED.”

The payphone slams against the metal bracket.

He stands there, breathing heavy. Staring at his reflection in the glass of the vending machine.

Brown hair. Tan jacket. Calm. Measured.

Ted.



SCENE: MIRROR, MIRROR

Ted’s POV – Later That Week

It’s a normal afternoon. Well, as normal as it gets when the woman you conquered might be sending you cursed mail and you’re pretty sure you killed someone who looked like a distant relative.

I’m sitting outside a café, drinking coffee that tastes like burnt chalk and spying on girls I can’t touch anymore. Not because I’ve lost interest — because someone is watching me. Always. It’s her. I don’t know how, but it’s always her.

I flick through the paper. Another article about Lake Sammamish. Still “missing.” Still no bodies. That should make me feel something. Pride, maybe. Relief.

But I don’t feel relief. I feel—

What the fuck?

Across the street.

There I am.

Brown jacket. Brown, shiny fucking shoes. Hair parted the exact same way. Even the stupid fake-smile grimace I practiced in the mirror for the crisis centre interviews. He’s wearing it like it’s his.

He’s me.

Walking with this little bounce in his step like he’s earned it. Like he didn’t claw his way up from mediocrity by mimicking the arch of my goddamn eyebrows.

I nearly choke on my coffee.

He holds the door open for some girl — not Maris, obviously. Maris wouldn’t even sneeze in his direction. But the girl looks grateful. She’s smiling at him like he’s harmless. Like he’s sweet. Like he isn’t wearing my fucking life.

I stare harder. No, no, no. His gait is off. Just a hair. One of his legs is longer — left hip drags slightly. Amateur.

But the rest?

Uncanny.

I feel my pulse start to race. Like I’m watching a snake crawl out of my skin and pretend it invented charm.

I lean forward. Mutter to myself.

“You want the jacket, fine. You want the shoes, sure. But the face? You’re not owed the face. I earned the face.” I look away quickly when the elderly woman to my right stares as though she’s witnessing pre-marital sex.

I can feel it building — the heat behind my ears, the twitch in my eye. I want to cross the street and slap him. Hard. Just to see if he bleeds like me. Or maybe I grab him by the collar and whisper, "Tell me, Stephen — when did you first decide you wanted to die?"

And then I see it.

He does the hair swipe. My hair swipe. The one I do in the Crisis Centre. The one I practiced before TV interviews after I got caught spying on the Democrats.

He’s not just copying me. He’s studying me.

And for a second — just a second — I wonder if Maris made him.

Like a golem. Like a joke I wasn’t in on.

Because that’s the thing. If there’s one thing worse than being hunted—

It’s being replaced.





SCENE: GOD’S IN THE HOME, ALL’S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD

Maris’s POV — Observing Ted and Stephen, August 1974

From the second-floor window of the conservatory, I have the perfect view of both.

Ted sits across from the café, hunched over his coffee like it insulted his mother. His eyes twitch. His hand keeps reaching for a cigarette he doesn’t light. He’s sweating, but the sky’s overcast and the breeze is icy for August. He’s spiralling.

It’s divine.

Across the street: Stephen.

My Stephen. Bundy-lite. Crispy on the edges, raw in the middle. Hair parted with a level of reverence bordering on religious. He’s started buttoning his shirts to the third notch — just like Ted. Started glancing at reflections like he’s surprised he has one.

He holds the door open for a girl with strawberry-blonde hair. Ted’s face flinches. He looks like someone just shoved a mirror in his mouth and told him to swallow.

I watch them both, sipping a gin and tonic through a silver straw. The glass is chilled. The air is sweet. The pain in my thighs from a week ago has faded into something useable. I filed the assault away, right next to the first one by Hunter, the greenhouse kill, and the dead-eyed cry Quinn made when Henry backhanded her in ’68.

My recovery is not linear. It’s strategic.

Ted tries to stand. Sits again. Then stands.

He looks like he’s about to commit murder or wet himself. Possibly both.

I lean against the frame of the window and smile — one hand tracing the glass in a slow, vertical line.

“Does he remind you of someone, Teddy? Or is it just hard to watch someone succeed while you struggle for scraps?”

I could almost pity him. If I weren’t so thoroughly entertained.






SCENE: THE FALL GUY

Stephen’s POV – University of Washington, August 1974

He’s just left the lecture hall when the sirens begin.

Not loud. Not flashing. Just there — like they’d been waiting for him to step into the right shadow.

Two officers. Not campus security — real police. Tan uniforms, badges that catch the light. They’re polite. That’s the worst part. They treat him like someone they already feel sorry for.

“Stephen Brady?”

His mouth goes dry. “Yes?”

“You’re under arrest in connection with an ongoing investigation. Please place your hands behind your back.”

“Wait—what?” He laughs. “Is this uh, uh—this has to be a mistake. I didn’t do anything.”

“You have the right to remain silent.”

He looks around. No one helps. No one moves. A girl in the corner clutches her books like she’s afraid he’ll explode.

One of the officers pats down his jacket. Lifts the paperback from his pocket.

The Stranger. Of course it is.

“Hands behind your back,” the second officer repeats. “Now.”

He complies. Slowly. The cuffs click shut.

He opens his mouth again — to protest, to beg, to say anything that will make this go away.

But all that comes out is:

“I’m not him.”

And for the first time in weeks, he’s right.

---

SCENE: THE LION WALKS THE PERIMETER

Maris’s POV — Caldwell Estate, Late Afternoon

I’m on the terrace. The sun’s low and golden. There’s orange juice (spiked with vodka) in my glass and blood on my mind.

Henry steps outside without his blazer, which means he’s serious. His tie is loosened. His brow is tense. That’s all the warning I get.

He says nothing for a moment — just watches the trees. Then:

“One of your friends got arrested today.”

“Which one?” I ask, without looking up.

He glances at me. “The one who used to be a redhead.”

“Ah. Stephen.”

He nods, slowly. “Interesting boy.”

“Eager.”

He sips from my glass. Doesn’t ask. He doesn’t need to.

“You know what they’re saying?”

“That he’s the Lake Sammamish suspect?”

“That he fits the profile,” Henry corrects. “That he drives a tan VW, wears brown patent shoes, volunteers at a call centre. That he used to have freckles but seems to have ‘matured’ into something else.”

I don’t respond.

He watches me for a long time.

“Do you believe he did it?” I ask, finally.

Henry laughs.

“I believe he won’t be the last.”

Then he brushes a strand of hair behind my ear — gently, too gently. The way he did when I was nine and lying about the broken birdcage.

“Come with me to Salt Lake. The hotel needs someone with your… temperament.”

I raise an eyebrow. “Quinn won’t like that.”

He smiles. “Quinn’s opinion is not in the current budget.”

He turns. Walks back inside.

I sit there another full minute.

And then I smile.

---

SCENE: HUNGER IN A THREE-PIECE SUIT

Ted’s POV – Outside the Caldwell Estate, Just After Sunset

He doesn’t know what he’s doing here. That’s a lie. He knows exactly.

He’s leaning against the same stone gatepost as before, staring at the lion statue. It looks more smug now. More judgmental. Like even the sculpture knows he’s lost.

He doesn’t see her — Maris — but he feels her. Somewhere behind the window. Watching.

He lights a cigarette. It burns too fast. So does his throat.

Then — footsteps.

Heavy. Rhythmic. Precise.

Henry Caldwell.

Three-piece charcoal suit. Cufflinks sharp enough to open arteries. A face like someone who pays people to disappear. Maris as a man.

They lock eyes.

Ted smiles. Small. Harmless. “Evening.”

Henry doesn’t blink.

“You think you’re clever,” he says.

Ted’s smile falters. “Excuse me?”

“You think you’re a hurricane.” He steps forward, voice low. “You’re the forecast, son. The real storm’s already come and gone.”

Ted straightens. “I care about her.”

“No,” Henry says calmly. “You want her. That’s different. And dangerous.”

“I haven’t done anything.”

“You’ve done plenty. You left her in the dirt, inches from death.” He steps even closer. The air changes. “But more importantly, you’ve underestimated her. That… will be your undoing.”

Ted scoffs. “She’s not what you think.”

Henry’s gaze hardens. “Oh, I know exactly what she is.”

He adjusts his cufflink. Then:

“If I see you here again, you’ll be returning to your sister, no, wait, your mother Louise as fertiliser.”

He turns. Walks back through the gates.

Ted doesn’t move.

The lion statue smirks.


SCENE: PLANES, POLAROIDS, AND PARANOIA

Ted’s POV — August 1974, 2:43 AM

The bug is packed. Not neatly. Not the way he used to do it. Just thrown in — shirts, razors, half a Bible, the rest of the fuel fund. He’s trying to leave quietly. To Salt Lake. New faces. Clean slate. Maybe Carol’s body will never be found.

Maybe Maris won’t find him there.

But she will.

She always does.

He opens the fridge, drinks straight from a carton of milk. It’s sour. He drinks anyway, hoping for a reason to vomit. Acid churns in his throat.

There’s a thud outside. He jumps. Just a branch. Just a night bird.

Just paranoia.

The phone rings.

He stares at it. No one calls at this hour. Not unless—

He answers.

A woman’s voice.

Not Maris.

Older. Soft. Familiar.

“Hello? Who is this?”

He blinks.

“Louise?”

“Yes, this is Mrs. Bundy.”

Silence.

Then a different voice. Smooth. Cold.

“You should ask your son where he was July fourteenth. You might not like the answer.”

“Who is this? Is this some kind of joke? Who is this?”

The line goes dead.

---

SCENE: THE DAUGHTER WHO DOESN’T NEED TO HIDE

Maris’s POV — Same Night, 3:12 AM

She hangs up and turns off the lamp.

The phone is still warm in her hand.

Louise’s voice was shaking. Just a little. Not a full collapse — that will come later. But it was enough. Enough to ripple through the mythology. Enough to weaken the anchor.

Maris stretches out on the chaise. Naked under a silk robe, hair still damp from the bath. The scent of elderflower lingers on her collarbone.

She dials again.

This time, Ted picks up immediately.

“Hello?”

She doesn’t speak.

“Who is this?”

Still silence.

“Maris?”

Now she breathes — just once, a low exhale. His breath catches.

“Where are you?”

She waits. Three seconds.

“I’ll always be around, Ted.”

She hangs up.




SCENE: “IT’S JUST BUSINESS”

Caldwell Estate — Dining Room, Morning Light

Quinn’s cigarette smoulders untouched in the ashtray. She only lights them when she wants to look in control. The fact that it’s unlit means she’s already lost.

Millie is silent — pale, lips bitten raw, staring into her grapefruit like it might explain why she wasn’t chosen.

Henry folds his napkin.

“Maris will be going to Salt Lake.”

No preamble. No opportunity to interrupt.

“She’ll be overseeing the Carlyle-Caldwell expansion — the flagship hotel downtown. Astrid’s son failed upward into a corner office. Maris will handle the real work.”

Quinn stiffens. “She’s not in business, Henry.”

“She is now,” he says.

Maris sips her tea.

“I think it’ll be refreshing,” she says. “Less rain. Less noise.”

Quinn glares at her. “And what will you do when the media starts circling again? You think going to Utah will erase what people are saying?”

“People say a lot of things,” Maris replies. “They called Jackie a whore. They called Nixon a saint. Neither was true.”

Henry stands. “It’s settled.”

Millie pushes back from the table. “What about me?”

Maris doesn’t look at her. “You’re staying.”

“But—”

“You’ll hold down the fort,” Quinn says sharply, grateful for a bone to throw. “You’ll represent the family here.”

Millie’s eyes flick to Maris, desperate. “You always leave when it gets bad.”

Maris turns, finally meeting her gaze.

“Have you ever thought that you’re the reason things get boring? Who the fuck wouldn’t leave?”

Swearing’s not allowed at the table, normally. This time, though, even Henry roars with laughter.

SCENE: THE VISITATION

King County Jail — Visitor’s Wing, Glass Partition

Stephen is thinner. Paler. Hands trembling in his lap. The jumpsuit doesn’t fit right — not just in size, but in aura. He’s still trying to adjust to being the man he isn’t.

The guard brings him to the window.

And then he sees her.

His posture straightens. Hope flares. It’s pathetic.

“Maris,” he says. “You came.”

She picks up the phone on her side of the glass.

He fumbles with his.

“I didn’t do it,” he blurts. “You know that, right? I’d never— I wouldn’t hurt anyone.”

She tilts her head. “You wouldn’t?”

“I—I tried to help. Always. You said I was kind.”

“I say a lot of things.”

His throat tightens. He presses a hand to the glass. She doesn’t mirror it.

“Please,” he whispers. “Tell them.”

“I will,” she says. “In court.”

His eyes widen.

“I’ve spoken with Detective Keppel,” she continues, voice gentle, almost maternal. “They’ve asked me to testify. To establish a psychological profile. What you were like before the break. How your behaviour shifted.”

“Maris—no. Please. You know this isn’t right.”

She smiles.

“I do.” Stephen presses his hand harder to the glass. “I don’t know what’s happening. Everyone’s looking at me like I’m… evil.”

Maris’s voice softens. Just a little.

“You’re not evil, Stephen.”

He breathes. Relief. Like a man given oxygen after days underwater.

“I’m going to get you a lawyer,” she adds. “The best one. Quiet. Discreet. Someone who understands how special you are.”

His eyes glisten. “You’d do that for me?”

“I’m doing it for justice,” she says, with a smile so warm it almost looks real.


And then she stands.

On the way out, she passes Keppel in the hall. He looks up, clipboard in hand.

“You sure you’re comfortable doing this, Miss Caldwell?”

She nods. “Absolutely.”

“Anything you want in return?”

She thinks about it. Then:

“A car. Something inconspicuous.”

Keppel blinks. “To go where?”

“Utah,” she says, without missing a beat. “It’s quieter there.”

She holds in a giggle when she thinks of Tom Evans, the lawyer she’s going to arrange. Worse than a public defender. Someone she wouldn’t even hire to send a cease and desist letter.


CHAPTER FINAL: YOU DIDN’T THINK I’D LET YOU LEAVE, DID YOU?

Ted’s POV – Salt Lake City, August 1974

He’s made it. Sort of.

The motel is bleak — textured stucco, rust stains in the sink, buzzing fluorescent light that hums like a nerve about to snap. He closes the door. Locks it. Bolts it. Chains it. Checks the window. Then checks again.

He breathes.

He’s safe. He’s sure of it.

He unbuttons his shirt, lets it fall off his shoulders. The mirror’s cracked, warped. He avoids looking too long.

There’s an envelope on the bed.

He hadn’t seen it before.

White. No name. No address.

He stares at it.

His mouth goes dry.

He picks it up.

Inside: A Polaroid.

Not of him.

Maris.

Sitting at a dining table.

Wearing his button-down shirt — the cream one with the faint brown pinstripe. Unbuttoned to her sternum, collar wide, sleeves rolled to her elbows.

One long leg crossed over the other.

Louise Bundy sits beside her, smiling faintly. Molly is across the table, head tilted. Liz— sits quietly at the edge, watching Maris like she’s trying to figure out what she is.

There’s tea on the table. Cookies. China plates. Cloth napkins.

Maris has one hand on a silver butter knife.

And she’s looking straight into the camera.

Smiling.

On the back of the photo:

“You didn’t think I’d let you leave, did you?” (PS — Molly said your shirt smells like dead girls. I told her that’s just how a man smells when he refuses to shower for a month. Your mother got the real story.)

Ted’s lungs clamp. His hands start to shake.

He flips the envelope upside down.

Another item falls out.

A motel key.

To the next motel. The one he booked for tomorrow night. He hasn’t told anyone. Not Liz. Not Molly. Not even his own mother.

He drops everything.

Stumbles into the bathroom.

Vomits.

His knees hit the tile. The bile burns. His eyes blur.

And then—

The scent.

Gardenia.

He looks up.

In the cracked mirror—

His collar. His shirt. Her perfume.


Let him run. Let him hide. Let him pray to the god he pretends to believe in. I already know the end of this story.

And when I tell it… He dies on my term
