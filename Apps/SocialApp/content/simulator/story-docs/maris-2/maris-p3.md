SCENE: "SOMETHING'S COMING"

Caldwell Estate – Night – Maris’s POV

The phone rings twice before I answer. Only two people are allowed to reach this line. One is dead. The other is my father.

“Maris.”

His voice is quiet. Not soft — calculated. Like the air before a landslide.

I lean back on the silk settee, letting the bourbon warm my ribs. “Daddy.”

“You need to be careful.”

I raise an eyebrow. “Always am.”

There’s a pause. Then the exhale of a man who knows how the world works and still doesn’t like it. “A detective came by the office.”

“Which office?”

“Seattle.” Another pause. “Didn’t say much. Just that they’re revisiting a few disappearances. Looking into connections. Names.”

I swirl the drink. Ice clinks. “And mine came up?”

“Not directly.” His voice is flatter now. “But people are talking. One of the girls went to UW. Another worked near the hotline.”

“Coincidence.”

“Maris.”

I glance at my nails. “I’ve been very discreet.”

“I’m not saying you haven’t. But times are changing. Girls like you don’t get the benefit of the doubt anymore. Not when you outshine the boys. That’s when they start to hate you.”

I let that sit. Let it stretch across the gold-trimmed silence of my room.

“I know what I’m doing,” I say finally.

“I know you do.” His tone shifts — the way it always did when I was eight and the maid found blood on my blouse. “But don’t wait for the storm to hit. If you need to get ahead of it…”

“I already am, Daddy.”

He chuckles, dry. “That’s my girl.” Then lower: “Let me know if you need a clean way out.”

Click. SCENE: "THE ENVELOPE"

Ted’s POV – Evening – His Apartment

The walk from the mailbox feels longer today. The key sticks. My hands are shaking and I don’t know why.

Inside: one envelope. No return address.

The paper is expensive. Thick. Perfumed.

I know it’s from her.

I don’t open it right away. I take it to the table, clear the mess — old notes, candy wrappers, the latest law school catalogue. The one I keep reading and rereading, like it’s scripture.

I slide my finger under the flap.

It’s a photocopy. My LSAT results.

Below average.

Beneath that, a rejection letter from UW.

And beneath that… a note. Typed. Just like before.

Try Utah. They’ll let in anyone.

I stare. My ears start to ring.

She knew.

She knows.

I rip the paper in half. Then again. Then again. The pieces scatter like ash across the laminate floor.

She’s in my head. In my mail. In my future.

And somehow — somehow — she still thinks she’s better than me.

She wants war?

Fine.

Let’s see how well she plays when the gloves come off. She’s still just a woman.


Ted Bundy’s POV — First-person Caldwell Estate, 1974

---

It’s the shoes.

Italian leather, oxblood, borrowed from a dead man’s closet — polished to a high shine and worth more than my rent. I stole them from a senator’s son who overdosed in a frat house three weeks ago. He didn’t need them anymore.

The blazer’s borrowed. The tie is mine. So is the smile — the good one. The one that makes women trust me.

Quinn Caldwell isn’t just a woman. She’s the woman. Five-foot-nothing of Dior and distaste, hair so smooth it looks like it’s never been touched by human hands. The type who’d shoot you before she raised her voice. Maris got it from somewhere.

And if I can get under her skin — inside her home — inside her — then Maris loses.

The door is answered by a maid I haven’t seen before. She eyes me like I’m fertilizer. Good. That means I dressed right.

“I’m here for Mrs Caldwell,” I say, mid-chuckle, like I’m remembering an inside joke. “She asked me to stop by. Something about the Republican fundraiser?”

She doesn’t question it.

Of course she doesn’t.

I follow the smell of cashmere and the perfume Liz begs for to the sunroom.

She’s there, of course — reclined, as though she were sculpted into the furniture. A crystal glass in one hand, a book in the other. Pale silk blouse. Bare feet. A pearl clip glinting behind one ear like a blade disguised as jewellery.

She doesn’t stand. Doesn’t even blink.

“You’re the boy with the hair,” she says.

I smile. “And you’re the woman with the cheekbones.”

“Don’t flatter me. I was beautiful before your mother stopped wetting the bed. I see Maris wasn’t joking about the decline of staff quality.”

I try to laugh. She doesn’t.

“Can I sit?”

“If you must.” There’s visible disdain. Maris definitely gets it from her.

I lower myself carefully onto the chair across from her, legs crossed, hands folded. The way I’ve seen senators sit. It digs into my back almost by design.

“I came to apologise,” I begin, “for the… intrusion last time.”

“Which time was that?”

“The estate visit. I think I startled your daughter.”

“Which one?” Her eyes flick lazily to mine. “The useful one or the one still living under my roof without an offer to a university?”

I pause.

She smirks. “You don’t have an answer. That’s disappointing.”

I shift in my seat. “I admire Maris. Her… poise. Her intellect.”

Quinn laughs once. Short. Dry. Like a bone cracking.

“You don’t admire Maris. You want to possess her. And you can’t.”

I stare at her. I see why her husband wallops her.

She leans forward, resting her glass on the table with perfect aim.

“Let me guess,” she says. “You told her she reminded you of your mother. Then told your mother she reminded you of Maris. You pretend to love women, but you have disdain for them when they don’t submit.”

My breath catches.

“You’re the kind of young man who quotes Camus to impress vapid little girls but couldn’t define absurdism to save your life. My girls studied in Switzerland; Maris read the classics by the time she was ten” She tilts her head. “And your shoes are half a size too large. Maybe an entire size if you took out the Odor-Eaters.”

I blink. Hard.

She takes another sip. “If you want advice, go home. Shave. Read something that wasn’t written by an angsty man in 1952 who thought he was above serving our nation in the second war. And stop sniffing around my daughters. Maris certainly isn’t interested. I know when she is, and it’s rare. She wouldn’t waste her affection on you.”

I try to interrupt, but she cuts me off with a single sentence.

“You smell like someone who wants to be rich.”

The silence between us goes nuclear.

She stands. Picks up her book. Turns her back.

“You can see yourself out, Mr. Bundy.”


SCENE: THE WRONG ONE

Maris Caldwell’s POV — First-person Caldwell Estate — Upstairs Hallway — 1974

---

He’s doing it again.

I watch from the staircase landing, fingers curved around the balustrade. The old wood is polished smooth — like everything else here, it doesn’t remember a single sin.

He’s outside Millie’s door.

Shoulders tense. One hand in his pocket. One knock away from a mistake.

He hasn’t seen me. Good. Let him embarrass himself.

His pride is raw from earlier — I can smell it. Quinn must’ve filleted him. She always did have a way with dull knives and permanent scars.

He adjusts his jacket. Fixes his hair.

I could laugh. He’s nervous.

For Millie.

She opens the door.

The idiot wears my lipstick shade. A silk chemise too low for her chest, too high for her sense of decency. Eyes wide like a rabbit begging not to be run over — but she’s the one lying in the road, waving traffic down.

“Hi,” she says softly.

His smile is the kind that makes broken women feel chosen — even when they’re just the default. They’re weak. Easy targets. Low effort.

“Can we talk?” he asks.

She nods. Steps aside. As always.

He enters.

I wait.

Count slowly to ten.

Then I walk to my bedroom and close the door.

He thinks he’s hurting me.

But all he’s doing is confirming what I’ve always known.

He can’t tell the difference between desire and proximity.

Let him fuck the spare twin. Let him realise halfway through that she crumples and falters like Liz, like the type of woman he tires of after minutes. He wants Millie to be me. He’s ready for round two of disappointment. Her pussy isn’t as tight, her breasts aren’t as high, her stomach still has flab from no discipline. She’ll moan too soon, cling too long, and say the wrong name when she tries to ask who hurt him.

Because it won’t be her.

It’ll always be me.


SCENE: THE ONLY TIME I WON

Millicent Caldwell’s POV — First-person Caldwell Estate — Bedroom — Later That Night

---

He didn’t stay long.

He never said my name out loud.

But he came.

And that has to count for something.

I’m still lying on the sheets. My chemise pushed up, hair mussed in a way that almost looks intentional. If I don’t move, if I don’t breathe too deeply, I can almost pretend I’m her. The version of her he wanted. The one he could control.

He touched me like I was borrowed.

Like I was a compromise.

But I let him. I wanted to let him. Because for once, I had something she didn’t. Something she’d thrown away that I could keep.

He didn’t kiss me after. Just stood, buttoned his shirt like he had a train to catch. I asked if he wanted water. He didn’t answer.

The door closed behind him with a softness that felt like an insult.

I press my fingers to my lips. Still tingling. Still trembling.

Does this make me his?

Or does this make him mine?

A tear slips out before I can stop it. I wipe it quickly — I’ve seen how she mocks tears. I’ve felt how she mocks them.

She’ll know. She always knows.

But I did it anyway.

Because for one small, silent night… I was the one he came to.

Not her.

Me.

And even if he never does again, she can’t erase this.

Not from him.

Not from me.

---

SCENE: THE WRONG TWIN

Ted Bundy’s POV — First-person Summer 1974 — Caldwell Estate

---

I don’t know what I was expecting.

A hand on my chest. A slow smile. Maybe the sound of her laugh, low and secret, like it had been waiting for me all along. The kind of warm reception wives of politicians give the gardener or pool boy when they think their husbands aren’t watching.

Instead, she recoiled.

Quinn fucking Caldwell looked at me like I was some dog that had rolled in off the lawn. Like I’d mistaken her hospitality for invitation. Like I was the scum even the maids couldn’t get rid of.

“You must be confused,” she said, voice taut, cold, almost mechanical in its brutality. “This isn’t that sort of house.”

She didn’t even raise her voice. Didn’t need to. She used tone, like all women who’ve been married too long to the same man and learned how to maim with their words instead of the thallium their foremothers used.

Her perfume hit me like sulphuric acid.

I left without speaking. Without touching the doorframe. I know what fingerprints do. I know what mistakes look like.

But I was vibrating.

Furious with rage.

I couldn’t let it end there. Not with her walking away like I’d embarrassed myself.

So I found the next best thing.

Millie.

The spare.

---

She was in bed, reading some pathetic paperback with a dog-eared cover and a title like The Unquiet Wife. Hair in a ribbon. A tray of untouched toast beside her like she’d been waiting for someone to eat it with.

She looked up like a child being offered a balloon.

“Hi,” she whispered.

And then — like a door already unlocked — she opened.

---

It wasn’t good.

She kept gasping at the wrong moments. Reaching to touch my face like she knew me. Saying my name too often, too gently. As if we were making love. As if it meant something. As if she finally meant something.

I wanted to slap her. I almost did.

Instead I turned her over. Held her by the neck so she couldn’t turn back to meet my gaze.

It didn’t help.

Her skin was soft in the wrong way. Damp in the wrong places. She smelled like talc and lilies and desperation. She whimpered at the slightest pressure and said “I’ve never—” like I gave a fuck.

Maris said that to hurt, not to placate. She knew how much that means to a man, and she used it to enrage me, while Millie was probably just telling the truth or taking advice from Seventeen magazine.

Maris bites.

Maris dares you to earn her.

Millie just lay there, trembling, offering her pulse like a sacrifice.

I couldn’t finish.

So I faked it.

Grunted, rolled off, and buttoned my shirt while she lay there staring at the ceiling like she’d just been made holy.

She asked if I wanted water.

Water.

Christ.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My throat felt like it was closing around sand.

I left before the rot could sink in.

---

Now I’m back in the car. The window’s cracked. My palm is still damp. I rub it against my pant leg until it stings.

It doesn’t help.

Because I can still feel her sickly sweet hands trying to comfort me.

The sweat. The stammering. The desperation.

The wrongness.

It’s like I fucked a ventriloquist dummy in Maris’s skin. The eyes look the same but felt underwhelming, almost embarrassing. Needy and hopeless.

Like someone tried to copy a symphony with a kazoo.

Even her moans were off-tempo. Every noise she made was to validate my pleasure, which in turn, offered me absolutely nothing but a severe dip in my libido and a desire to take pills I didn’t think I’d need for a few more decades.

God.

I almost pity her.

Almost.

Because now I know why Maris keeps her on a leash. Why she doesn’t even flinch when Millie begs to be loved. And why Millie doesn’t deserve to be loved.

She’s not a threat. She’s not some weapon to be brandished against Maris to celebrate my manhood, my victory.

She’s a trial run, or the training wheels you use before you can finally ride your bike properly.

A puppet.

A dress rehearsal for a part she’ll never get.

---

SCENE: THE ENVELOPE THAT SMILED

Ted Bundy’s POV — First-person Morning – His Car – Just Outside Roosevelt

---

It’s on my seat.

No stamp. No address.

Just my name, typed.

Inside: one Polaroid. Crisp. Fresh. Glossy, as wet as my memory of it.

It takes a second to register.

The first image: Quinn. My hand hovering just above her shoulder, face straining toward charm. Her expression? Knife-sharp revulsion. Mid-recoil.

The second photo is worse.

It’s me. With Millie.

From behind. Taken through the crack in her bedroom door. I could’ve sworn it had been locked shut.

I’m shirtless. Her fingers on my chest. My face—God. I look like I’m concentrating. Like I’m trying.

The note beneath it is typed in blue ink on Bond paper.

“The great seducer reduced to begging the spare twin and being laughed out of the master suite of her mother. This is the man who claims to understand women?”

Folded inside the same envelope is a third page. A photocopy.

It’s a rejection letter. In the same format of LSATs I tried to conceal from Liz and my family. The shame bit like a cornered hyena.

University of Washington School of Law. 1973. Mr. Theodore Robert Bundy. "Unfortunately, we are unable to offer you a place in our program…”

I feel it like a slap.

This was private. This was mine.

At the bottom, she’s annotated it in red pen:

"Maris never even applied. Said it was beneath her.”

There’s one last sentence typed at the bottom of the page:

“You were right, Ted. Millie really is the only one who’ll have you.”

---

I crumple the letter, but it doesn’t help.

Because I know what this is.

A mirror.

And she’s holding it up so I can see the whole grotesque truth she perceives as reality.

Every flaw.

Every flinch.

Every second I wasn’t who I know I am.

---



SCENE: YOURS TRULY, FROM THE SHADOWS

Maris Caldwell – First-person POV Later That Morning – Caldwell Estate – Dressing Room

---

I don’t even pretend not to laugh.

The kind that curls in my throat like warm brandy. Quiet. Controlled. But true. The kind of laugh that tastes better than milkshakes and French fries.

He opened it.

I know he did.

He always opens things that are marked for him. The world has handed him too little, so he takes anything with his name on it like a gift, he has the entitlement of a Nobel prize recipient without the work. I knew he’d read every line. His eyes would snag on the rejection first, then the annotations. Then the photos.

I picked the worst angle — low, up the chin. He looks like a thirsty, straining boy. The kind who wears aftershave samples from magazines and thinks no one notices. I caught him just as Millie leaned in, all baby desperation and lip gloss. His face is half turned, mouth open.

If impotence had a poster, it’d be that frame.

The Quinn photo was a last-minute decision. I wasn’t going to include it. But then I thought: No, he needs to be reminded. Reminded that not every woman can be tricked. That rejection tastes worse when it comes from someone you wanted to believe was beneath you.

I sip my coffee. I silence the laughter that threatens to continue spilling out.

A shadow passes the hall window. His car, maybe.

He won’t come in. Not again.

He knows better than to step into a house that will dig the knife of humiliation in until it eviscerates you.

---

SCENE: THE STORY SHE TELLS HERSELF

Millie Caldwell – First-person POV Nexr Day – Sunroom – Curled in Her Cardigan

---

He didn’t say it. But I felt it.

When he left, he didn’t slam the door. He didn’t growl or scowl or twist my name into something cruel. He just looked… shaken. Like he’d seen something that cracked the world a little. Like he might’ve met the woman he truly wanted to be with.

And he looked at me. Not like I was a mistake. Not the way Daddy and Maris look at me, like a burden to be contained. Not the way Mother looks at me, like I’m a doll to sit pretty and take instructions.

Like I mattered. Like he was pleased with me.

I haven’t told Maris he came over again. She’d claw her own eyes out if she knew I was the one he ran to after she broke him.

Maybe this is my chance. Maybe he sees now.

She toys with people. She doesn’t feel things. But I do.

I feel everything.

I unwrap the cardigan from around my knees and smooth my hair. Maybe he’ll come back tonight. Maybe he’ll want to talk. Just talk.

And if it becomes more… if it means something…

Maybe this time I’ll keep my eyes open. Maybe this time he won’t picture her.








SCENE: THE FUN ONE

Liz Kendall’s POV — Evening, Bundy Apartment First-person

I don’t want to admit I’m eavesdropping. But I am.

Molly’s in her room with her dolls, and I’m just outside the door, frozen by the sound of her voice. Sweet. High-pitched. Giggling.

“She’s so pretty. Like the lady in Cinderella.” Pause. “She gave me candy and said I could stay up late if you didn’t come back!”

My blood runs cold.

She’s talking about her.

Maris.

I push the door open, too hard. Molly startles. Her doll falls from her lap. “What did you say?” I ask. Molly looks up, confused but not afraid. “I like her. She’s fun. Can she come again?”

The bile rises before I can swallow it. Maris was in my home. With my daughter. With my fiancé.

“Maris isn’t a babysitter,” I snap. “She’s… not coming back.” I don’t know how she was here in the first place.

Molly’s lips tremble. “But she said I was her favourite. She said we were friends.”

I turn before the rage boils over. In the kitchen, I open a drawer and slam it shut. I feel like a stranger in my own home. Like every part of me — mother, woman, partner — is being replaced. Rewritten.

First Louise. Now Molly. Even my daughter thinks Maris is the better version of me.

SCENE: THE REPORT

Same night — Bellevue Police Department — Liz’s POV First-person

The waiting room smells like bleach and cigarettes. I sit with my purse clutched tight against my ribs, trying not to cry.

I don’t know what I’m even doing here. I wasn’t going to come. I told myself it was paranoid. That Ted loved me.

But then I thought about her again. About Molly. About Louise.

And something broke.

The officer leans forward. “Ma’am, you said you have concerns about your boyfriend?”

“Yes.” My voice is dry. I clear it.

“His name is Ted Bundy. He’s been… strange lately. Lying. Disappearing for hours. I—I found a photo in the mail. A picture of me, taken without my knowledge. And he said it was from a girl named Maris. But I think he’s lying. I think he took it.”

The officer raises an eyebrow. “Do you feel threatened?”

I pause. Then: “Yes.” He writes something down.

“Have you seen anything else?”

I think about the flowers. The staged concern. The bruise on my forearm that continues to linger. About Molly asking for her.

I chew on my lip, thinking it’ll settle me. It doesn’t. “I think he’s dangerous.”


SCENE: THE WARNING

Ted Bundy’s POV — Crisis Centre Office — Night First-person

I’m reorganising the index cards by county when my supervisor clears his throat behind me.

“Ted?” “Yeah?” I turn, all smiles.

He doesn’t smile back. “There’s a detective here. Asked to speak with you off the record.”

My jaw tightens before I let it. “Oh?” He nods. “Said it’s routine. A girlfriend filed a concern.”

Girlfriend.

My ears ring. But I nod. Calm. Curious. Just another upstanding man trying to help his community.

I meet the detective in the hallway. He’s paunchy, overconfident, wearing a tie too short for his gut. “Mr. Bundy. Thanks for your time.” “Of course. What’s this about?”

He pulls out a small notepad. “We’ve received a report from a Miss Elizabeth Kendall. Said you might’ve been involved in some… suspicious activity.”

I feel my molars grind together. I keep smiling. “Liz? Oh no,” I laugh, just enough. “She’s been under stress. Her daughter’s been having night terrors again. I’ve done everything I can to support them, but sometimes she misreads things. Emotional women — you know how it is.”

He doesn’t nod.

“She received a photo in the mail. Of herself. Unmarked. She says you told her a woman named Maris sent it.” My tongue burns.

“She was upset,” I say softly. “I wanted to soothe her. Maybe I shouldn’t have made up a name. It was just a dumb joke.” “You made up Maris?”

I look the detective straight in the eye. “I made up a lot of things, officer. To try and keep someone calm who thinks she’s being watched. But I’d never hurt Liz. Never.” I lower my voice, just enough. “She means the world to me.”

---

SCENE: INTERIOR — TED’S APARTMENT — LATER THAT NIGHT

Ted Bundy’s POV — Alone First-person

The door slams behind me.

I lock it. Then again. Then again.

Then I tear the place apart.

Books off the shelf. Glass in the sink. One of Liz’s stupid pressed flowers flutters to the ground and I crush it underfoot.

She went to the police.

After everything. After all the dinners, the fucking flowers, pretending to care about her kid —

And for what? Because I let her feel watched? Because I let her feel what I feel every time I see Maris whispering into someone else’s ear, laughing at me across the room, plucking at my nerves like she owns them?

I gave Liz order. I gave her structure. I pretended I wanted her.

She was nothing. A loose, flabby substitute.

And now she’s betraying me.

No. No — she thinks she’s safe because she went to a man with a badge. She thinks paperwork can save her from me.





SCENE: DADDY’S LITTLE GIRL

July 1974 — Liz Kendall’s Apartment — Third-Person (Close to Liz)

The Barbie was sitting upright on the windowsill. Facing out. One tiny arm raised, as if waving.

Liz didn’t remember Molly leaving it there. She was usually so careful. Dolls went in the toy box. Clothes went on hangers. Everything had a place.

She walked over absently, tucking a dish towel into her waistband, thinking maybe the breeze had nudged it up from the floor.

Then she saw the note.

Folded, tiny. Taped to the back of the doll’s neck with a single piece of scotch tape. Typed.

“I like Maris better. She’s prettier.” — Molly

Liz’s stomach dropped.

She peeled the paper off slowly, like it might burn.

The font was too neat. Not handwritten. Not childish. Molly was six. She didn’t even own a typewriter.

“Molly?” she called, her voice sharp now. Her daughter’s head popped around the corner, curls bouncing. “Yeah, Mommy?”

“Did you… leave this note?”

Molly frowned. “What note?”

She held it up.

Molly blinked, confused. “That’s not my writing.” Then: “Why would I say that? I like Maris. She’s fun.”

The room went quiet. Liz stared at the doll. At the note. At the locked apartment door.

“Where did you get this Barbie?”

Molly shrugged. “It was on my bed this morning.”

---

SCENE: THE WATCHER

Ted Bundy’s POV — One Hour Later — Inside His VW

The curls are easy to spot.

Molly runs toward the school gate, lunch pail swinging, oblivious to the rust-colored Volkswagen idling across the street.

She turns at the last second — smiles at someone. A friend. A teacher. Not him.

He exhales through his nose. The sound rattles.

She’s just a kid. That’s what he tells himself. A stupid, soft, sticky-fingered little kid. But Maris looked at her like she mattered. Kissed her forehead once. Held her hand crossing the street.

“She reminds me of Diane,” Eleanor had said. But that’s the problem, isn’t it? They all do. Until they don’t.

He watches until the bell rings. Until Molly’s gone. Then he drives away slowly, gripping the steering wheel hard enough to blanch the knuckles.

He doesn’t need to touch her.

She’s already said too much.


SCENE: HAUNTING HEIGHTS

Downtown Seattle — Late Afternoon — Ted’s POV

He sees her from across the street.

It’s the gait first. The height. The way she tilts her chin when she laughs — like she’s being admired and knows it. Like Diane used to.

She’s walking beside Maris.

They’re headed into a record store on University Way. Maris has that floaty silk blouse on again, the one that clings when she moves. But he doesn’t care. Not today.

Today, it’s the tall one.

She’s wearing a rust-red scarf tied close to her neck. The same color Diane wore that night in the rain, when she said, “I think we want different things.” And then left him.

He can’t breathe.

His mind tries to build the timeline — tries to wedge logic between obsession. Diane’s in California, isn’t she? Or is it San Francisco now? Did she come back? For a visit? For him?

He takes a step off the curb.

The woman turns. Just for a second.

Not Diane. The nose is wrong. The eyes too wide. The mouth twitches into something almost cruel.

And Maris sees him.

Not directly. But she knows. Her eyes flick past him as if scanning shadows. Then she leans in and says something to her tall friend — something funny, clearly — because the woman throws her head back and laughs. Diane never laughed like that.

He stands frozen on the sidewalk. Watching. Burning.

And the worst part?

They don’t even look back.

SCENE: THE COPY THAT CUTS DEEP

Caldwell Estate — Maris’s Private Room — First-person

He thought it was her. God, he really thought it was Diane.

I had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing when I saw his face. That pathetic glimmer — like a stray dog catching the scent of its old master. I could practically hear the mental monologue. She came back. She saw me. She wants me again.

Except she didn’t. Because Diane doesn’t exist anymore. Not for him. And certainly not for me.

The woman I brought was taller, yes — 5’11” in flats. Freakishly tall. The level of tall that most sane men would avoid like the plague. Long dark hair. Legs for days. But her laugh? Hollow. Her eyes? Empty. I picked her specifically because she had no real soul. A living mannequin. The kind of girl who’d nod when I told her to, wear what I told her to, walk where I told her to. Just long enough for him to bite.

And he bit. Hard.

I slipped her a fifty for the afternoon and a second one for the scarf. That was the color Diane wore the night she gutted him emotionally, wasn’t it?

I’ve read everything. Even the letters he never sent. Especially those.

He looked at us like he’d just glimpsed salvation — then realised it was a mirage. That’s the thing about mirrors, darling. You can only stand them if you’re not hideous on the inside.

I taped the photo above my desk. Black and white. Grainy, but the desperation in his eyes is unmistakable.

Next to it, I wrote in red ink:

“Still not her. Still never will be.”

And beneath that, in typewriter font:

“For a man who hates women, you sure keep chasing shadows of them.”

I’ll send it in a week. Maybe two. Just long enough for him to think I’ve forgotten. Let the wound scab before I peel it again.

I do wonder how Liz is holding up. Must be exhausting, dating a man who sees other women in your every angle.


SCENE: THE BUNDLE UNRAVELS

Louise Bundy’s House — Midday — Maris’s POV

She makes lemon squares.

I don’t eat them, of course — I never eat sweets made by women who cry while baking, it seems utterly unhinged and a dose of empty calories— but I let her believe I might. I even take one with a paper napkin, folding it just so like it’s a delicate specimen under glass.

We sit in the breakfast nook. Doilies. Sun through gingham. And a china clock that ticks like it’s trying to finish someone else’s sentence. I imagine that happens a lot around here. I can’t imagine being elderly and still having rugrats tearing the house apart, while the eldest is tearing women apart.

“Teddy always loved lemon,” she says. “But he used to hate anything with crust. Would pick it apart with his fingers until the filling sagged.”

I smile. “He seems very… meticulous.”

Louise laughs — a high, nervous trill. “Oh yes. Even when he was little. Always wanted to present well. The tie had to be perfect. The stories rehearsed. He used to practice his smile in the mirror, you know.”

Of course he did. He’s barely a human. I should know; I taught myself to blink to stop freaking the nannies out. One of them still unravelled when they brought their puppy for a quick visit. It was shortly after that it was floating in the pool. Someone had strangled it. Daddy watched me do it and then told Mother she was crazy for thinking I could.

She dabs her mouth, even though nothing’s there. “He wasn’t raised alone, you know. People always assume that because he’s so independent.”

I tilt my head. Let her talk.

“He had cousins. A whole houseful of them. My parents were…” Her voice falters. “Old-fashioned.”

She doesn’t elaborate, but I don’t need her to. I’ve done the math.

“You know,” she continues, “for the longest time, Teddy thought I was his sister.”

I let that one sit.

She laughs again, but this time it catches. Like a cough hiding behind a memory. “When he was about six, I finally told him. Sat him down and said, ‘I’m not your sister, sweetheart. I’m your mother.’ I went officially from Eleanor, his sister, to Louise, his mother.”

“What did he say?”

She blinks. “He didn’t. He just… stared. For a long time. Then he asked if he could go outside.”

Outside. Where you bury the parts of yourself that don’t match the picture. Where he buries headless women now.

“And the place you gave birth?” I ask sweetly. “That was in Vermont, wasn’t it?”

She nods. “Burlington. Elizabeth Lund Home. It was… quiet. Full of rules.”

Rules. Ted hates rules. He only ever follows them when he’s the one making them.

I file it all away. The cousins. The lies. The lemon pie. Each one a brick in the foundation he built over a landfill of secrets.

Louise reaches over and touches my hand. “You’re good for him, Maris. He’s always needed someone with steel in them.”

I squeeze back, just enough to warm the illusion. I make a joke about my mother descending from a British steel magnate. I never met my maternal grandfather, but he was rich enough to have disdain for my father. But inside, I’m already writing the next note. Already picturing the clipping I’ll send. The address. The map. The headline about the home for wayward girls.

And at the bottom, a single line:

“Maybe he never left.”




SCENE: THE SECOND COMING

Ted Bundy’s POV — Summer 1974 — University District

I see her from across the street. Tall. Brunette. Tapered ankles and a long camel coat despite the warmth. She moves like Diane used to move — not with grace, but decision. Like she doesn’t just know where she’s going, but why.

I stop.

My legs hesitate like a child’s, waiting for permission. I haven’t hesitated in weeks.

She steps into the bookstore.

I follow.

The door chimes, stupidly cheerful. The clerk doesn’t look up. I trail her to the non-fiction aisle. Psychology section. Of course.

She’s skimming the spines with long, bare fingers.

I wait too long before saying something. When I finally do, my voice cracks like a teen boy’s.

“Excuse me. I… I think I’ve seen you before.”

She looks up.

Hazel eyes. Not Diane’s, but close enough to detonate the memory. She’s older. A little tired in the face. But God — the bone structure. The height.

She blinks at me, polite but bored. “I don’t think so.”

“I’m Ted.”

Still blank.

“I used to… I dated someone who looked a lot like you.”

She smiles — the kind you give to men who don’t matter. “Lucky girl.”

Then she turns back to the shelf.

Just like that.

No double-take. No flicker of fear. No hint of recognition. Nothing.

I feel my throat tighten.

“I—I’m in law school,” I lie.

She doesn’t respond.

“I worked for the Republican Party. I knew Dan Evans. I helped with the Rockefeller campaign.”

Still nothing.

“I… I’m actually headed to Utah soon. Full scholarship.”

She nods, distracted. “That’s nice.”

That’s nice.

Like I’m a pamphlet for summer classes. Like I’m the pizza delivery guy she’s trying to shoo away after a minute of small talk.

She picks up a book. Something about psychology. I want to rip it out of her hand and scream Do you know who I am? But I don’t.

I walk out of the store with my lungs full of glass. A head full of thoughts. A crowbar in the car.


SCENE: THE CONFESSION First-person — Ted Bundy’s POV Setting: Liz’s apartment, late night, August 1974

---

She opens the door in that robe again. The blue one. The one from the photo. It makes her look fatter than she already is.

I almost turn around. Almost walk away.

But I smile instead—fractured, tight. “Hey.”

Her mouth curls into that worried shape she thinks is affection. “Teddy?”

She steps aside. I walk in.

The apartment smells like cocoa and detergent. Too clean. Too lived-in.

I sit on the couch without asking. Hands clasped between my knees like a goddamn Boy Scout.

“I saw someone today,” I say softly.

She pauses. Shuts the door. “Who?”

“She looked like Diane.”

Silence. Her body stills.

“Not exactly,” I add. “Taller. Sharper. But the resemblance was… eerie.”

She stays standing.

I look up at her, eyes wet. Practiced. “It got me thinking. About everything.”

A beat.

I lower my voice. “There’s things I never told you.”

She moves toward me slowly, like she’s afraid I’ll break. Or explode.

“I didn’t grow up like most kids. My mother—Louise—she lied to me for years. Told me she was my sister. That my grandparents were my parents. I didn’t know the truth until I was twelve.”

Her breath catches.

“I used to wonder what was wrong with me. Why I always felt… outside. Like I was playing someone else’s part.” I let the words drift, like smoke. “I tried to fix it. I really did. Church. School. Debate team. Girls like Diane.”

Liz sits beside me now. Too close. Her thigh brushes mine.

“But no matter what I did, I always felt… dirty. Like something rotten was sewn into me before I was even born.”

She reaches for my hand. I let her.

“I got rejected from UW Law.” I say it like it hurts, I’m almost good enough to force a singular tear out. “Twice. Couldn’t even break into a state school, Liz.”

Her fingers tighten. “That doesn’t mean anything—”

“It means I’m a fraud,” I snap. Then soften again. “I wear these suits. Smile for the right people. Say the right things. But inside? I’m still that bastard kid from the Lizzy Lund Home for Unwed Mothers.”

I shake my head.

“There’s something wrong with me, Liz. I know it. I feel it. But when I’m with you…” I meet her eyes. “It quiets. Just for a while.”

She’s crying now. Just like I knew she would.

I brush her hair back. “You’re the only one who’s ever seen me. Really seen me.”

She throws her arms around me. Pulls me to her chest like I’m a child.

And I let her.

Because I need her to believe she’s saving me.

Because I need a place to sleep tonight.

Because I’m not done with Maris.

And this time… I won’t leave empty-handed.


CENE: THE REASON

Liz Kendall’s POV — First-person August 1974 – The morning after

---

He’s still asleep on the couch.

Curled toward the cushions like a boy. Hair mussed. Mouth slack. Hands tucked under the pillow I fluffed for him.

I watch him from the hallway, fingers wrapped tight around my coffee mug.

I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw his face from last night—that face. Not the charming one. Not the flirtatious one. The one that cracked. The one that told me about being lied to, rejected, humiliated.

The one that made me feel like I’d been chosen.

He could have gone to anyone. Said all that to anyone. But he came to me.

I rehearse it in my head:

“You’re the only one who’s ever seen me.”

I don’t know what that means, but I want it to be true.

I want to believe that all the strange moments—his disappearances, the silence, the stories that never quite matched—were just symptoms of a man trying to survive himself.

He’s been hurt. That’s what I’ll tell the police, if they ever ask.

He’s been hurt, and I’m helping him heal.

That’s why he was with that Maris girl. She tempted him when he was weak. And Diane—maybe she was part of that old pain. Maybe he’s just trying to forget her.

That’s what I’ll tell myself. Because I love him. Because he needs me.

Because he said he feels better when he’s with me.

I go to the kitchen and pour the rest of the cocoa into a thermos. I’ll leave it by the door with his keys. A small gesture. Something to let him know he’s not alone.

Something a girl like her would never do.

---

SCENE: THE OBSERVER

Maris Caldwell — First-person Same morning

---

He’s not hard to find. All I have to do is follow the smell of guilt.

His car’s parked three blocks down from her place, angled like he was in a hurry. Like someone might notice.

I take the long way around. Past the bakery. Past the fire hydrant the local mutt pisses on every day. I’m not rushing.

I already know how this ends.

I position myself at the bench across the street. Big sunglasses. Straw hat. A stack of pamphlets I have no intention of reading. From this angle, I can see right into her kitchen window.

She moves like a woman who’s made a choice.

There’s a little bounce in her step. A twitch of hope in her posture.

I wonder what he told her. That he was broken? That he’s trying? That she’s the only one who can fix him?

I sip my coffee. It’s gone cold, but I don’t mind.

Watching her oscillate between happiness and despair gives me enough warmth.

When she places the thermos by the door, I almost laugh.

She’s pathetic. Fat. Used. But useful.

Because the deeper she sinks into his bullshit, the harder it’ll hurt when she drowns.

And when she finally calls the police, it won’t be because she’s afraid.

It’ll be because she’s angry.

Because no matter how much she loves him… he’ll always want someone else.

Me. He’ll either have me, or hunt women who look like me.


SCENE: DEATH BY A THOUSAND FAVOURS

Maris Caldwell — First-person August 1974 – Caldwell Estate, late morning

---

It’s always the same with men like him.

They fall apart in private, and think the performance is hidden. Like the world isn’t watching the cracks in real time.

Like I’m not watching.

I know he’s still at her place. I saw her leave the thermos. I saw her wipe her eyes on her sleeve like she was honoured to be chosen as his safe place.

No man who needs saving is worth saving.

But I’m glad she thinks she’s special. Her belief in him makes the eventual unraveling all the more delicious.

He’ll break her soon. They always do.

And when he does, it won’t be with rage or fists. It’ll be something smaller. Forgetting a birthday. Laughing at her pain. Letting her spiral just enough to look crazy in public.

It’s what narcissists do best: murder with deniability.

I tuck the latest clipping into the envelope. A college announcement: a law school rejection list, printed too small for most people to care. But not too small for me to circle his name. Bundy, T.R.

Ted didn’t get in. Again.

Not even to UW — again. He’s making my work too easy for me. I thought by now he’d give up and try somewhere even worse, like Oregon. Where he took the prettiest victim of his.

I sign the corner with a lipstick kiss. Not because I think he’ll believe it came from someone else. Because I want him to know it’s me.

He can’t stop me. He can’t match me. And worst of all, he knows it.

As I seal the envelope, I catch my reflection in the mirrored bar tray. Still flawless. Still dangerous.

“Rosa,” I call, placing the envelope on the silver tray. “Please have this delivered to the mailroom. And tell Mother I’ll be out this afternoon. I’m planning something... charitable.”

She nods with all three of her chins, disappearing down the hallway.

I glance at the orchids in bloom near the French doors. Delicate. White. Short-lived.

Like most of the men I meet.

I’ll let Ted stew a little longer. Let him pretend he’s safe.

Then I’ll make my next move.

Maybe Louise deserves a new heirloom tea set.

Maybe Liz needs a reason to start doubting again.

Or maybe it’s time for another souvenir.

Either way, it’s my game now.

And I never play fair.



SCENE: REJECTION Ted Bundy – Evening – His Apartment – First-Person POV

I know what it is before I open it.

The envelope sits on the table, too pristine. No creases. No postmark. Just my name, typed with mechanical precision. Not handwritten.

I tell myself it could be anything. A flyer. A formality.

But my hands sweat. My throat closes.

I tear it open.

Inside: the rejection letter. University of Washington Law School. They "regret to inform" me. Again.

They regret nothing.

Beneath it, something else. Tucked like an afterthought:

A lipstick print. Red. Bright. Kisses the corner of the letter.

Then I see it:

"Guess you're not as smart as you think."

Typed. No signature.

Maris.

I crumple the page. Then uncrumple it. My fingers leave sweat stains.

She knew.

She knew I applied. She knew I failed. She knew before I even opened the letter.

My vision tunnels. The apartment walls seem to pulse. My face is hot. My mouth tastes like blood.

I want to hit something. Break the mirror. Snap the chair leg. Instead, I pace.

Back and forth. Back and forth.

She’s mocking me.

She knew this would cut. Knew this would wound me deeper than a knife in the gut. And she’s right. It does. Because without law school, I’m nothing. Just a dropout with a pretty face and bad teeth.

She’s already in the house on the hill. Already winning over Eleanor. Already replacing me.

I see her smirk in my mind. That cold, perfect lip curl that says: You’ll never be enough.

I walk to the bathroom. Splash my face. Stare into the mirror.

"You're better than her," I whisper. "You're smarter. You're the real predator."

I pull out a folder. The newspaper clippings. The photos. The maps. The sorority schedules.

If she wants war, I’ll give her war.

But not just any kill.

This one will scream Maris.

I'll leave her a message in blood.


SCENE: THE SUGAR IN THE LEMON TEA Maris Caldwell – First Person – Evening – July 1974

I’m humming something pretty while I clean the blood from my fingernails.

Not mine. Not tonight.

The boy was never meant to die, not fully. Just enough to limp. Enough to scream. I needed the sound. I needed to know Ted would hear it — not in his ears, but in that black little walnut of a soul he pretends is a heart.

I wear silk tonight. Pale yellow, tight at the waist, flared at the skirt. A color Diane wouldn’t wear. A color Liz couldn’t pull off. I swirl honey into my tea with a silver spoon and make plans.

Tomorrow, I think I’ll visit Louise again.

Maybe I’ll help her with her hair. Maybe I’ll find Ted’s childhood photo albums in the linen cupboard and leave one open on the kitchen bench. Let Liz see what a demonic child looks like. Let her wonder what it means that no one ever told him the truth.

Maybe I’ll send Liz something else. A note from Molly. Something innocent, like: “Miss Maris says angels don’t always have wings.” Let the mother unravel.

I light a cigarette. Inhale. Blow a perfect ring toward the ceiling.

He’s unraveling. I can feel it. The way men like him always do when they realise someone else might be in on their little secret.

Let him try to retaliate. Let him play dress-up with Millie. Let him sob into Liz’s robe.

I’m not done.

And he hasn’t even seen what I’ve buried in his mother’s garden yet.


SCENE: THE AUTHOR OF HER RUIN Ted Bundy – Third Person – Late Night – July 1974

He types it on her typewriter.

He’s been in her house. The guest house first, then the greenhouse. Then upstairs — where she keeps her hairbrushes arranged by length and color like a surgeon's tray.

She hadn’t changed the ribbon. Amateurs never do.

The keys stick slightly. Her H is dying. He presses harder to make the letter print. He wants it to look like she wrote it. Wants the police to believe that maybe, just maybe, this little debutante bitch lost control and needed someone to understand.

The confession is short. Just enough.

"He was still warm when I kissed him goodbye. I liked that. The softness. The quiet."

A date. A vague location. A name only the dead would recognize.

Next, the Polaroid.

He’d followed her after the scarf. Parked two blocks behind the boy with the limp. She didn’t see him — she never fucking sees him — but the camera did. Click. Flash. A second before the hit. The boy smiling. Her hand on his arm. Like they were just friends. Like he wasn’t about to become meat.

He slips the photo into the envelope, then the page. He licks it shut slowly. Leaves no fingerprints. Wears gloves. Wears control.

The second copy? That one he’ll drop at the precinct under a windshield wiper.

This one — this one is for her.

He writes her name on the front in his neatest print.

Maris Caldwell. Private.

No return address. No fingerprints. No room to breathe.

---

SCENE: THE GIRL WHO BLINKED Maris Caldwell – First Person – Morning – July 1974

It arrives with the morning papers. No stamp. Hand-delivered. Which means he was here.

I recognise the envelope before I touch it. Cream cardstock. My name in a careful, practiced hand. Not his usual scrawl. This one’s been laboured over.

I open it in the music room. Sunlight on the ivory keys. Somewhere downstairs, Rosa is ironing napkins.

The first thing I see is the photo.

Me.

And him.

Before.

A moment I didn’t know was being watched. A second before violence — not his, mine. A private second. Mine.

I stare at it too long. Because he shouldn’t have this.

Because I didn’t see him.

Because I blinked.

Then the page.

Typed. On my machine. The jammed letters on the typewriter tend to smudge. The probability of another having the same quirks is low. Lower still are the chances of Ted being able to afford to purchase one.

"He was still warm when I kissed him goodbye..."

No signature. Just silence. He

My hands stay steady. But my breath slows. I read it again. And again.

He’s escalating.

This isn’t a threat. He isn’t warning me.

It’s a trap. One of those

A perfect little paper trail with my name on it — and my fingerprints if I weren’t careful. He wants me arrested. Or worse: he wants me caught because it would make the story cleaner. Neat little twist ending. The vixen with blood in her hair brought to justice. Bravo. Rich girl traipsing along the sticky linoleum in King County PD. The joke’s on him. I had to deal with that early. 13 years old to be precise. Waited for Henry. Refused to make a statement. I didn’t crumble as a child.

I’m not going to crumble now.

I burn the letter.

I bleach the gloves.

And I make a new list.

Because if he wants to play confession… He’s going to hear mine next. He whines and moans about the haves and the have nots. He hates women with money, women with beauty, women with charm. We steal the oxygen he thinks only he’s entitled to. He doesn’t quite understand how money works, since he’s never had it. His juvenile bear traps will slice through him next.


SCENE: THE WOMAN WHO HELD HER TONGUE TOO LONG Third Person – Louise Bundy’s Living Room – Midday – July 1974

He arrives with tulips. Pink, slightly wilted. The kind Liz would like.

Louise doesn’t notice the browning edges. She’s too busy setting out the lemon bars Maris brought last Sunday. Ted recognises the plate — blue willow china, a pattern from his childhood. One of the few things that stayed the same between Philadelphia and Tacoma and Salt Lake.

Louise is wearing the lilac cardigan again. The one Maris complimented. He wants to rip it off her shoulders.

She pours tea. “Teddy, I meant to ask you — what was the name of that little girl from the church picnic? The one who made Molly that angel crown?”

He stiffens. “What girl?”

“Maris,” Louise hums. “I’m so glad she’s been around. I was starting to worry you’d fall for one of those political types with no soul. But Maris — oh, she has feeling, Teddy. You can see it in her eyes. Even when she’s quiet, it’s like she knows.”

“She doesn’t know anything.”

Louise stirs her tea. “She knew about Vermont.”

His heart stops.

Louise doesn’t notice.

“She asked if we’d ever been back there. Said she heard about the hospital. The Elizabeth Lund Home?” Louise’s brow furrows. “I never liked that place. The girls were treated like criminals. I didn’t choose to be there.”

He drops his cup.

This time, he doesn’t pretend it was an accident.

Louise looks up sharply, mirroring the disdain Maris wears when she’s pretending to be polite.

“Who told her about Burlington?” he asks, voice low.

Louise blinks. “I don’t remember. Maybe you did?”

“I didn’t.”

“Well, someone must have—”

“I didn’t.”

Silence.

Louise folds her hands.

“I think you should leave, Teddy. I don’t appreciate your tone. Your siblings are still children, and I won’t tolerate the disrespect. It’s setting a terrible example.”

He stands. The room is too small. The walls too close. The scent of lemon bars sticks to his throat like bile.

“You should be careful who you let in this house.”

Louise doesn’t flinch. “Maybe you should be careful about how you speak to your mother.”

He leaves the flowers. Slams the door hard enough to rattle the windows.


SCENE: THE LETTER FROM HOME Ted Bundy – First Person – Night – August 1974

It’s not even sealed properly.

No calligraphy. No perfume. No expensive envelope. The kind you buy in packs of twenty at a drugstore checkout line. Yellowing, fraying at the corners, fingerprint smudges on the flap. I almost don’t open it. I think it’s junk. But then I see the handwriting.

I freeze.

I’d know that cursive anywhere.

Louise.

It’s not addressed to me directly. Just tucked inside a blank envelope with no return name, no stamp. Like someone delivered it by hand.

I sit down slowly, as though the letter might detonate.

The ink is faded — not new. This was written years ago.

---

Ted,

I told Samuel I didn’t want you. I said it plainly. I didn’t know who the father was — could’ve been that man from church, could’ve been Samuel your grandfather himself (God help me), or worse. Samuel said we’d be taking you home no matter what. That it was God’s plan. But I never believed in that kind of God. I wanted to leave you in Vermont. The shame I’d tried to hide when I first realised you were growing in my belly. I took pills. I fell down the stairs. Neither worked.

I told Julia you were wrong. Broken. She said you had dead eyes — said you’d grow into something we’d regret. She woke up to all the kitchen knives around her, pointing directly at her. You were smiling. You were only three, but you enjoyed it so much, your face was glowing. Once, I caught her praying in the kitchen after you pushed the neighbor’s dog into the creek. Said it was only a matter of time.

You were four.

I don’t blame you, really. You came from a place that wasn’t clean. How could you be?

But I tried, didn’t I? I tried to raise you proper. Church, manners, piano lessons. Samuel kept pretending. I think he hoped you’d forget. That maybe if we never told you where you really came from, you’d become someone new.

But children remember things.

Like the time you locked your cousin in the closet and laughed while she screamed. Or when you told me Diane looked like the girls in your detective magazines — the ones you said were art. Women on the front cover tied up, begging for mercy.

I still have the clipping about Annmarie Burr. You said you prayed for her. But your shoebox had one of her hair ribbons in it. I burned it when you weren’t home.

I don’t know who you are now. But I hope God sees you before the world does.

– L

---

I read it once. Then again. Then again. I lose count. The words become scribbles. I wipe my eyes, willing the letter to disappear. It doesn’t.

My hands don’t shake. My breath doesn’t catch.

But something behind my ribs ruptures.

I rip the paper, but it doesn’t help. It only makes it worse. Because the writing is still there in my head. The details I can’t ignore. The details I can’t suffocate.

She never wanted me.

Julia called me a monster.

And someone — someone — has touched that part of me I never speak of. The ribbon. The shoebox. No one knew about that but me. I buried it years ago. But she knew.

Someone has seen inside my past.

Someone knows everything.

I want to scream. I want to kill.

Instead, I stare at the torn pieces in my lap.

Then I start to laugh.

Because I know who sent it.

And I know exactly what I’m going to do. It’s no longer Diane I picture pleading for her life while blood trickles down her chest, her face bruised, lips cut. It’s not her hair I picture in my fists as I force myself down her throat. It’s Maris.



SCENE: THE DRAWER IN THE LAUNDRY Maris Caldwell – First Person – Midday – August 1974

The Bundy house smells like Woolite and poverty. Johnny’s still schlepping in a county kitchen, serving meals to convicts like he has for the past three decades. Louise thinks being elderly makes people forget she’s a whore who had a child out of wedlock.

I wait until Louise is in the garden, humming hymns to the hydrangeas. Molly's watching cartoons with the volume too high, dumped here because Liz is working and clearly no teenagers want some extra money for a sitting job. The floorboards creak, the windows screech when you try to close them and there’s no maid to berate when coffee goes cold. It’s funny that Carol wanted people to think she lived this way.

The laundry cupboard is second from the end. The shelf above the starch spray holds a shoe box, scuffed at the corners. There are receipts in it. And something else.

A letter. Yellowed, frayed at the edges, folded in three like a prayer no one answered. I recognise the handwriting. I've seen it on grocery lists and Sunday notes to the neighbours. Louise.

I don’t read it yet. Not fully. Just enough to confirm what I need.

Back pocket. Gloves on.

I leave a decoy in its place—a thank-you note from a charity envelope, same kind of paper, same faded blue lines. If she finds it, she’ll think she made a mistake. Memory slips at her age. Easy to blame it on the mind.

I let the screen door shut behind me a little too loud. Just enough to remind the house I’ve been here. I smile at Louise through the window. Wave once.

She waves back, smiling. The mother of the year.

---

SCENE: A BRUISE BETWEEN THE RIBS Ted Bundy – First Person – Evening – August 1974

Liz is late. I’m already two beers down. The kitchen smells like scorched sauce and her cheap perfume, a copy of the Opium Maris has started to wear. Molly’s gone quiet upstairs, finally, thank Christ.

The envelope’s in the trash, buried under coffee grounds. The letter’s ashes are cold in the sink. But the words are still in my ears. Shoebox. Closet. Dead eyes. Monster.

Liz walks in like nothing happened.

“Sorry,” she says, kissing my cheek. “They kept me late. Did you eat?”

Wrong question.

“Do I look like I fucking ate?” I snap.

She freezes. I see the apology forming in her mouth, but I cut her off.

“You know what your problem is?” I say, advancing.

Her eyes widen. I see the shift. The fear. Finally.

“You walk around like you're not disposable. Like you matter. Like you didn’t already hit your fucking expiry date the moment you got knocked up.”

She flinches. Good.

“You think I don’t see the way Maris moves? The way she thinks? She’s ten times the woman you ever were. And she hasn’t even tried yet. She’d cook me a gourmet meal while you think leftovers count as a dinner. You can’t even be a woman the right way.”

Liz starts crying.

I want to feel bad. I know I should. But all I feel is lighter. Happier.

Like I pulled a thorn out of my throat and gave it to her instead. I’m not delusional enough to think prissy Maris can make a meal. She’s never had to. Liz, however? She’ll believe anything if phrased correctly.


SCENE: THE SECOND SONATA Maris Caldwell – First Person – Bundy Residence – Late Afternoon

The timing is perfection. I arrive just as the screen door snaps shut behind him — Ted, striding off in that stiff, boyish huff he believes people equate to manhood. Liz is still on the porch, her face red, crumpled, blotchy as the paper bag I’m holding.

“Trouble in paradise?” I ask sweetly, crossing the lawn like I’ve lived here my whole life. The bag has peaches. Two of them are real. Rosa picked them up when I threatened to tell Mother that she’d left a splotch on her Kirchner painting. The one piece of German Expressionism she owns. Rosa didn’t do it. I did. But I can’t be deported.

Liz doesn’t answer. Good dog. She’s learning.

I knock gently. Louise opens the door with her usual fussy smile and a flash of relief that tells me everything. “Oh, Maris,” she says, ushering me in with both hands. “I swear you have a sixth sense.” Her arms are around me, pulling me close.

Molly appears at the base of the stairs like a ghost in denim. “Is it storytime?” she asks.

I nod. “Only if you’re good.”

Louise leans in. “He’s not himself,” she whispers. “That girl — Liz — I think she’s pushing his buttons.”

I almost choke on my own laughter. “Really? Poor thing. It must be hard for her. She’s a bit... hysterical, isn’t she?” My own body betrayed me this morning with a drop of blood that I silenced with a tampon, so I find it particularly funny.

Louise nods like I’ve just confirmed her darkest fears. Like I’m the second coming of Christ in girl form.

We sit in the front room. Liz doesn’t come inside.

Molly climbs into my lap, clutching her dog-eared picture book like it’s holy scripture. My jaw clenches when I feel her sticky little hands on my legs. I suppress the urge to cringe and pluck her off me. I understand why Mother sent us to Switzerland. Louise pours tea. There’s a crack in one of the cups. I make sure that’s the one I take.

“I told Ted he should be more like your father,” Louise says suddenly. “Confident. Proper. Dignified.”

I smile. “I’m sure he tries.”

We read. We sip. We play pretend.

Outside, I can see his car still idling at the curb. I let my voice carry just a little when I tell Molly, “Good girls always remember what real love looks like.”

SCENE: FRUIT FLIES IN THE DISH DRAINER Liz Kendall — First Person — Late July 1974

I open the door and freeze.

Louise is sitting at my kitchen table. Not in a rush. Not on her feet. Sitting. Comfortable. Like she’s been here awhile. Like this is her space.

And across from her, Maris.

In my chair.

Wearing one of my sweaters. A wine-colored cashmere I’d left in the coat closet. She’s smaller than me, but it drapes like it was made for her. Her legs are crossed delicately, the way I’ve never mastered without looking like I’m trying too hard. A half-empty glass of red beside her. She smiles when she sees me.

“Oh,” she says. “You’re home early.”

Louise stands, adjusting her cardigan. “Liz, darling. Maris came by to return something of Ted’s. We were just talking — I hope you don’t mind.”

I can’t speak.

Because I do mind. I mind so much I want to scream. I want to flip the table and watch the wine glass shatter against Maris’s porcelain teeth and skin too perfect to be real.

“Louise,” I manage. “Can I speak to you alone?”

“Oh, of course,” she says, too warmly. “Maris, would you excuse us?”

Maris rises. Smooth. Gracious. She touches Louise’s arm — like a daughter. Like she’s earned the right.

“I’ll just take a peek at the photos in the hallway again,” she says. “I love that one of Ted in the sandbox. So... pure.”

She disappears down the corridor, humming something faint and cheerful. I can smell my own shampoo on her. She’s used my bathroom.

“Liz,” Louise says gently. “You’re trembling.”

“You brought her here.”

“She’s lovely. And smart. And she reminds me of Diane—”

“Exactly,” I snap. “She’s a child.”

Louise’s brows knit. “She’s a woman, Liz. She has poise. Control. You’ve seemed so… frazzled lately. Maybe this is jealousy talking?”

I stare at her.

“You think I’m jealous,” I repeat.

Louise exhales. “Ted’s not an easy man, I know that. But Maris sees something in him that’s... redemptive. You’ve spent years trying to fix him. Maybe it’s time someone understood him instead.”

It hits like a slap. All those nights I sat by the phone. All the hiding. The crying. The patience. And for what? So a teenager with high cheekbones and the sense of a bloodhound could walk into my apartment and be chosen?

I feel it then — the wine bottle in my hand. I’m not sure when I picked it up.

“Liz,” Louise says sharply. “Don’t be hysterical.”

I laugh. The ugliest sound I’ve ever made.

From the hallway, Maris reappears, calm as a funeral. “Louise, it’s been a pleasure. I’ll let you two talk.”

She touches my shoulder as she passes. Just two fingers. It’s all she needs to win.

SCENE: THE POLAROID IN THE BUG Ted Bundy — Third Person — Moments Later

He slams the door. Shoves the key into the ignition with more force than necessary. Breath ragged. The wheel feels the wrath Maris should.

She was there. In Liz’s home. Wearing her sweater. Drinking wine from her glasses. Sitting beside his mother.

And smiling.

He huffs, looking toward the passenger seat. Something is resting there. Pale. Square.

A Polaroid.

He picks it up.

It’s Maris, of course. Legs draped across a clawfoot tub, her skin bare but for the one earring taken from the Hawkins girl he struggled to locate as the police swarmed. One heel still on. A smear of lipstick at the corner of her mouth. Her head turned just slightly.

On the back, a note in her handwriting:

Did Louise tell you about the traps you used to build? The ones for animals. And children. You’ve gotten lazy, Theodore. I’ve set mine better.

His stomach drops.

Because she knows.

She knows about the traps.

And worse — she’s telling him his life was never private, because his mother loves to run her mouth. Not even his memories are safe now.

He crumples the photo. Starts the car. The engine coughs. Then roars.

He’s going to kill someone tonight.

He just hasn’t decided who yet.


SCENE: THE HAWK RETURNS Maris Caldwell – First Person – Caldwell Estate – Next Morning

Daddy’s home.

I can tell by the sound of the car alone. Imported. Obscene. The tires kiss the gravel with a purr that only an Aston Martin makes. Daddy loves James Bond.

I slip the silk robe over my skin and walk barefoot through the hallway. Quinn’s locked in her suite with a migraine or a bottle of percocet — no difference. Millie’s probably still crying over something Ted said.

But Henry? Henry is always clear.

He’s already in the sunroom, a tumbler of something golden in one hand, the newspaper in the other. No hello. No smile. Just a glance.

“You’ve been busy,” he says.

“Define busy.”

He turns the page. “You left blood on the back patio. Poor form. You think the canines don’t notice?”

I wait. I don’t apologise. He doesn’t like apologies. He doesn’t appreciate weakness.

He gestures with his glass. “You’re making too much noise. Not enough artistry. This boy of yours — Bundy. He’s a mess. And you’re being pulled into it.”

I smirk. “You always did like a man with a suit and questionable behaviour. You said it reminded you of you.”

“I like power, Maris,” he snaps. “Not chaos.”

The room stills. Daddy is the one man I could never raise my voice to. Not because I physically would falter, but because he’s the only one who let me be me. Not push me into boxes and labels to be corrected. If Quinn had her way, I’d currently be in an asylum awaiting electroshock therapy and a lobotomy if the former didn’t take. I hide a laugh when I realise Ted’s grandmother was lobotomised. Louise’s lips couldn’t hold a secret if they were stitched together.

Then, softer: “I didn’t cover up what I did for you so you could play vigilante. If you want the family name to mean anything, you’ll stop leaving fingerprints — literal or emotional. And you’ll remember the rules.”

I meet his eyes. Cold. Sharp. The same ice I use on Ted. The ice that protected me from juvenile detention, instead sent to enjoy a curriculum in Switzerland that included weekend skiing and summer holidays in Aruba.

“I remember.”

He nods once, satisfied.

Then: “The hotel in Salt Lake is ready. If you need to disappear.”

I smile.

It’s not a suggestion.

It’s a command.

SCENE: BLOODLINE AND DISGRACE Third Person – Caldwell Estate – Drawing Room – That Evening

Millie is screaming. Again.

It’s the kind of scream that means nothing and everything. Broken glass. A snapped strap. Quinn hovering, shaking her Valium bottle like a rattle.

“You will not embarrass this family again, Maris!” Quinn shouts, eyes too wide, mouth foaming with motherly venom.

Maris doesn’t flinch. She sips her water.

Millie sobs on the divan like a child. “He said I wasn’t even—he said I was a practice run! He said he couldn’t finish because my skin felt like freezer paper—”

Quinn rounds on Maris. “What did you do to him? What did you say to make him hate her?”

And that’s when Henry steps into the room.

Everything stops.

“Enough,” he says. He eyebrows, now flecked with grey, are raised. This is a sign from childhood to shut up unless you want to be publicly flayed.

Even the birds outside pause.

He looks at Quinn. “You don’t raise sharp girls and then panic when they don’t tolerate disrespect. You don’t empower the snivelling embarrassments while punishing the leaders.”

She shrinks.

His gaze shifts to Millie. “If you can’t handle the heat, you stupid, blithering little girl, stay out of your sister’s fire. Nobody told you to fuck him. Nobody told you to cry.”

And then to Maris.

“Make sure Bundy never mentions our name to the police. Or I’ll make sure he never speaks again.”

He exits without waiting for a reply.

Maris watches him go.

She’s still smiling.

She always is when her father’s home.
