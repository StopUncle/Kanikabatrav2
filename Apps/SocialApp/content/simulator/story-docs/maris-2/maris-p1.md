The chauffeur mispronounces our name. “Cald-well.” It’s Cahl-dwell — soft “a,” whispered menace. He doesn’t know better. I don’t correct him, and I don’t care enough to ask him his. He’s not one of our regulars. I offer him a brief smile, and that’s costing me more than he can imagine. The flight from Zurich to New York was bearable – SwissAir seems to understand the importance of catering to its clients, while Pan-Am has the efficiency and timing of a blind, drunk driver navigating a new continent. I was chain smoking Gitanes in the Monarch Lounge at JFK for a vast amount of the six hour delay, allowing a portly attendant to refill my champagne flute while refusing the slop they were calling lasagne. As a result, there’s a mild throb behind my eyes that requires Vicodin and minimal conversation with idiots. He stares at me, mouth agape. I stare back at him until he jolts into action, noticing the Louis Vuitton trunks when a hyperactive boy nearly breaks an ankle tripping over them. ‘Call me Maris,’ I tell him, trailing him out of Sea-Tac’s uninspired, vomit coloured arrivals hall. He holds open the door of the gleaming black Cadillac. I slide into its buttery leather interior while he struggles with the luggage. I suppress a laugh as he tries to wrangle it into submission, swearing under his breath in an accent I can’t quite place. Guatemalan? Venezuelan? Anything but American. I take in the Seattle skyline – not quite New York, despite its strenuous visible attempts. Slabs of concrete and glass meshing together around the Space Needle, the Puget Sound reeking slightly less than the East River. The drizzle is light, almost underwhelming. I was looking forward to the patter of Washingtonian rain putting me to sleep at night, but I suppose listening to Hunter incorrectly recite the classics with confidence will do. I light another cigarette, taking a long drag before releasing a plume of blue-grey smoke through the gap in the window. The car glides past the waterlogged trees of Mercer Island, over the floating bridge, then curves through the dead glamour of early Bellevue — the kind that smells like wet magnolia, colonial ambition, and WASP drama that would put the Kennedys to shame. Lake Washington is bluer than I recall – I could’ve sworn it was dishwater grey when I left.

Our estate comes into view like an eclipse. The largest in the neighbourhood by an obnoxious margin. Georgian columns, slate roof, balustrades too ornate for the weather. The entrance is flanked by stone lions – a little much, for a family that sneers at ostentatious displays of money. I’m home. The gates slide open after two attempts of a click.

I step out, into the cold. My heels hit the stone with the kind of deliberate grace that etiquette classes drill into all future debutants in Seattle and daughters of diplomats in Gstaad. The façade has been pressure-washed since I left. That’s new. So is the

absence of my name on the welcome plaque. I suppose Quinn’s pretending she has one daughter now.

Inside, the scent of lilies and furniture polish strikes like a blow. The same but not. The foyer gleams. A maid I don’t recognise scuttles off with a dust rag – to be fair, I don’t focus on any of their faces unless they’re exquisitely ugly, so I could be wrong. The temperature is warmer than Seville in the middle of July. Oil paintings are hung up where any sane family would place photos.

I step onto the polished marble floor with unapologetic ease, despite the set of hazel eyes glaring at me with disdain. “It’s Carrara, Mother. It’ll survive. Hello to you too, by the way.” She’s impervious to the social contract of greeting people and welcoming them home. She’s equally impervious to the suffering of others, forcing us to exist in triple digit warm rooms because she’s perpetually cold.

She’s standing at the end of the hallway like an apparition from a film with too many costume changes and not enough plot.

Saying the word Mother while referring to her always feels unnatural — much like her ability to fulfil the duties that come with the title. She expects permanent gratitude for spreading her legs, having us cut out of her, then dumping us on a carousel of women named Bonnie, Marla, or Miss Joan.

She doesn’t respond.

She’s dressed for dinner. No guests in sight. Lips painted that muted whore red — her term, not mine — the shade she screeches about when I wear it. Nails a sickly nude. Her signature scent is Chanel No. 19: green, sharp, cold — a perfume that smells like a rejection letter from Vassar.

The hollows beneath her cheeks resemble an Auschwitz escapee’s, but her beauty’s still undeniable — Daddy’s only reason to marry her. She’d kill herself if she gained a pound. Eighty pounds is her personality.

I like the idea of slipping saccharin into her black coffee instead of the Sweet’N Low she’s hooked on — a test. She’ll either retreat to her master suite for weeks or follow Sharon Tate’s Valley of the Dolls exit and drop dead. Win–win.

She gives me a once-over. Eyes flick to the cigarette between my fingers. “We don’t smoke indoors anymore.” I blow the smoke upward. “How progressive. And here I was, thinking you held the fundraiser for Nixon.”

While I’m slipping off the shoes that have brutalized my legs, I’m barrel-rushed by Millicent – though her nickname Millie is a better representation of her insipid, sniveling child-like incompetence. Three minutes younger, an inch taller, and five pounds heavier — though I’ve spent years calling her the Michelin man to encourage dietary shame. Still hasn’t worked. The same blue eyes, jet black hair, full lips. Constantly defying her cool undertones and wondering why she looks orange, clad in outfits that would make Bozo the Clown weep. She wraps her arms around me, a clingy mess with tears creating a crisis for her mascara. Still using the sickly-sweet vanilla scented deodorant that I would secretly throw in the trash, only for it to be replaced within hours. She’s acting like I’ve returned from the dead, not Zurich. ‘Oh Maris, I’ve missed you so much. It’s just not the same around here when you’re gone.’ She grips on tighter. It's almost physically painful to tell her I’ve missed her too, the lie forcefully parting my lips, the left side of my jaw clenching with contempt. I’m stupid enough to believe the worst is over when she lets go of me, but then my gaze travels beyond her and I see him. Leaning against the wall in a manner that would result in capital punishment from Quinn if Mille or I ever replicated it. The alleged love of my life since I was 12, when he prized my legs apart and took what wasn’t ready to be given. Hunter Carlyle. A towering figure at 6’4. Nordic blonde hair women wish for when they reach for a bottle of Clairol. Pearly whites that would shock the Britons to discover. His white shirt is rolled up at the elbows, with the two buttons at the top undone revealing a tan that logically shouldn’t exist. The All-American golden boy grinning like a Cheshire cat as he envelops me. ‘My darling Maris,’ he says, his voice reminding me of why most women are on contraceptives. I give him a perfunctory peck on the lips, resulting in a smile from Quinn. The first of the evening. Nothing pleases her more than the idea of nixing me from the family and dumping me on Astrid Carlyle through an arranged marriage. Astrid confided in me one evening in 1973 that her son would propose in the new year. An hour later, she asked why I hadn’t touched any of the food on my plate. She should’ve asked how I managed to keep my breakfast down instead of hurling in her guest powder room at the idea. ‘Hunter, aren’t you a sight for sore eyes?’ The smile is forced, rehearsed to perfection, deserving of an Oscar. ‘We have so much to catch up on,’ he tells me. We don’t. He incessantly wrote me letters with incorrect grammar, questionable spelling and the kind of syntax that would give Dostoyevsky an aneurysm. They came in thick and fast, updating me on every mundane activity he’d done, almost a minute-by-minute breakdown. He believed he was making profound commentary on the Vietnam War, but didn’t know what Agent Orange was, and named Kuala Lumpur as its capital city. ‘Unfortunately, Henry couldn’t make it tonight. He’s setting up the new hotel in Salt Lake City. He sends his regards,’ says Mother, clipped and tight. She gives me the

onceover she’s famous for. “You look well.” Code for: not fat, not old, not yet replaceable. Still valuable chattel to offload to the highest bidder.

She acts apologetic, as though I’m braindead enough to believe he’s working. As though I don’t know he’s out fucking his way through a catalogue of her replacements — only blonder, younger, tighter. A one-man casting call for Quinn 2.0, but with less rage and better collagen.

The walls seem to close in faster than I’d hoped, the itch gnawing at me, almost ripping through my flesh as Rosa waddles around us, topping off coffee without being summoned. She gives me a bucktoothed grin; lipstick smeared across her two front teeth, and I offer a weak smile over the disgust roiling in my stomach. Hunter’s hand is on my thigh, a warm, vibrating presence that feels more like a cattle prod than comfort. I place my own hand over it to watch Quinn’s eyes light up, no doubt the marriage vows with a background of Debussy (maybe a little Elvis if she’s feeling particularly vulgar) playing in her mind. I can’t deal with it. I excuse myself for their sake as well as my own. The University of Washington wasn’t at the top of my list. Hell, I hadn’t even considered it when I was offered early entry to both Yale and Princeton — clearly scrabbling to out-liberal each other by attracting young women to their campuses.

An Ivy would’ve been entertaining — especially compared to the sister colleges, where girls attend either to latch onto a husband or develop a taste for homosexuality — but I hadn’t been in Seattle for a while. My family, my house, my old stomping grounds. I missed it more than I wanted to admit. Even if it means slumming it in a subpar university until I get bored.

The drive from Bellevue to campus is a cruisy twelve minutes down the 520 in the guilt-bought red Carrera. My father missed my high school graduation. His apologies tend to arrive in metallic form.

I snag a parking spot about a hundred yards from the psych auditorium. Spring rain follows a gnarly winter, and I haven’t missed it at all. I keep an ugly little umbrella in the glovebox just to ensure my flat-ironed hair stays flat, and my mascara doesn’t start crying before I do. I’ve never trusted cosmetic companies when they swear waterproof — and I’m not about to start now.

Textbook. Purse. Umbrella. Hermes scarf loosely over my head. Done.

The campus is already flooding with students — some fresh-faced, others looking like the great unwashed, impoverished by Nixon or their own poor decisions. A girl in horn-rimmed glasses trudges past me in a mustard-toned sack masquerading as a tunic. She looks miserable. If I looked like her, I’d be miserable too. I smile as I pass her, biting back the urge to dry heave. She clocks my silk blouse and the Kelly crook’d in my elbow, then glares in a way that suggests feminism is selective.

A wiry Vietnam protestor shouts nearby, dreadlocks swinging. “We have the power to stop the massacre. The government can’t continue if the people rise up!”

He’s sincere. His brow furrows like he’s the one in the trenches instead of being a burden to the taxpayer and an obstacle to the class we’re paying hundreds for.

“You know what, you’re right! I’ll be sure to pass the message along to my friends and family. We must stop the war,” I say, beaming. “It’d be unpatriotic to support our own country.”

He tilts his head, slow on the sarcasm. I keep walking.

Once the corridor clears, I slide into a seat mid-row. Perfect vantage point — central, exposed just enough. I like to observe, analyse, dissect… and allow myself to be watched in return.

A boy slides into the seat beside me — vaguely attractive, painfully nervous. “Um, hey. I’m Pete. I haven’t seen you here before.”

“Probably because it’s the first class of the quarter,” I reply, letting him squirm before offering a hand. “I’m Maris. Nice to meet you, Pete. Are you also pre-med?”

His cheeks colour. He looks toward the lectern. “No, I’m a psych major. Don’t think I could survive twelve years of college. Props to you, though. I’d imagine a girl like you in a magazine, not here.”

I’d imagine he’d be more grateful I humoured the idea he could get into medical school.

“Modelling made me want to blow a hole through my skull, if I’m being honest.” His eyes widen. I pat his shoulder. “Kidding. It just got old.”

He’s flustered. “So, you are a model? Or an actress?” “Perhaps something like that.” I turn back to my textbook.

I don’t let sevens distract me. Not when there might be tens.

The professor begins. He’s short, round, with a combover and enough shine on his head to blind me. He can’t work the lights. The fluorescent glare bounces off his scalp as he opens with a Jung quote I read in the fifth grade.

Midway through the introduction, the side door creaks open. A man enters. Ironed trousers. Pale burgundy turtleneck. Polished patent leather shoes. Clean-cut. No beard. No fringe idealism.

The professor narrows his eyes. “And who might you be, gracing us with your presence twenty minutes late?”

The man chuckles, but something curls at the corner of his lip — contempt, barely smothered. “Uh, Ted, sir. I got caught up… traffic. You know how it can be.”

The laugh is shallow. The apology weaker than it sounds. He’s trying to hide embarrassment — not very well.

There’s something about him. Not the accent. Not the eyes or the cheekbones. It’s the disconnect. The nervousness doesn’t fit the face.

He sits. His posture’s upright, but his discomfort is obvious — like someone trying to impersonate youth without understanding the lines.

He’s not one of us. No eighteen-year-old irons his trousers to have precise creases. No freshman has purple beneath the eyes that screams age over hangovers.

The jaw is sharp, but not young. The fingernails are clean, bitten down. He licks his lips as he scans the class. Tries to be casual. Fails. Rolls up his sleeves. Strong forearms — misaligned with the rest of him.

Pete — or Paul or whatever his white-bread name is — jolts me out of my thoughts. “Why’s your textbook already marked? This is the first lecture.”

I suppress the urge to sigh. “Wharton doesn’t give you grace for a low GPA.”

His brows lift. Out comes a giggle. “You’re applying to Wharton? As in… the university?” I squeeze my eyes shut. “No, I meant the homeware store.”

He blinks, neurons misfiring. “It’s just… most women — especially pretty women — get married after a bachelor’s degree. Wouldn’t you prefer that? It’d be a waste otherwise.”

I’d prefer to slam his head into the bench. Instead: “No, I think I’d prefer a degree from Wharton. Now, if you’ll excuse me — I’m trying to focus.”

Grumble. Groan. When I glance up, Ted’s face hasn’t moved — but now he’s staring straight at me.

Something sharp flickers in my chest. Not lust. Not novelty. Something older.

I hold his gaze. Smile — slight. Calculated. His lips are slightly asymmetrical. Cheeks, boyish. Eyes, cornflower blue with a hollowness I know intimately.

I break the contact. Smooth my skirt. His gaze follows.

He turns back. But the lecture’s over.

---

After class.

I slip out before the swarm, heels echoing. The stares I attract from others feel... alive, but lacking that dead-eyed weight.

At the vending machine, I attempt to buy a Tab. It jams. Naturally. I consider kicking it, but don’t think carbonated dishwater is worth a scuff on my loafers.

“You kind of have to, uh, use force,” a voice behind me says. “Let me try.”

Ted. Of course. Twenty minutes late to the lecture. Arrives immediately to save a damsel. His body presses lightly into the machine. First time fails. Second time, success.

He beams — proud, kindergarten proud — and hands it to me like a trophy. “Voilà.”

I take the can, grazing his fingers. His pupils dilate. Good.

“So, you’re good at making an entrance and bullying vending machines,” I say. “What else are you good at, Ted?”

He swallows. Licks his lips. “Helping people. Uh, skiing. Reading... does that count?”

He folds his arms. Guarded. Self-conscious. Waiting to be judged.

I press the cold can to my blouse. Let the condensation bleed through. His eyes drop.

“Reading counts. Kafka or Dostoyevsky?” “Sartre,” he says. “I... can get on board with some of that stuff.”

“Didn’t take you for an existentialist.” I pluck an invisible thread from his sweater. “Maybe when I’m your age, I’ll become one.”

“I’m—wait, your name? I’ve seen you on campus. Are you at McCarty?”

“Oh, God no. I’d rather die than live on campus.”

“I can walk you to your bus stop then. I’m, uh, good company.”

I laugh. “And I’d never be caught dead on a bus, either.”

I crack open the can. Step away. When I glance back, he’s still staring as though it’s the only opportunity he’ll get to see me. He shouldn’t worry about that – he’ll be seeing plenty of me.


CHAPTER TWO – THE ECHO CHAMBER

Maris – first-person present tense, May 1974

I like this record store because I’d never have an unintended run in with someone who is valued in society. It smells of stale patchouli and rain-rotted cardboard; the clerks cultivate dirt under their fingernails and consider showering an option. I drift through the stacks, glassy-eyed stoners staring at me like disciples of Manson. “Go Your Own Way” warbles from an abused turntable.

Carol’s already in the back, perched on a rickety library ladder, thumbing Bowie imports. She’s barefoot—always protesting something, even hardwood splinters. She’s stopped eating meat after attending a Hare Krishna Sunday Feast program. Impressionable, weak, begging for a master. That’s my Carol. A plum bruise ghosts her inner knee; I know exactly how she got it.

“You kept the bruise,” I say, low enough for only her.

She glances down, flushes. “You told me it looked artistic.”

“It does. Rodin would weep.”

She laughs—snort first, then the softer trill only I get to hear when her guard drops. That laugh once echoed in my east-wing bedroom, head thrown back against the fur rug that Mother thought left with the Matisse in the drawing room, her cardigan somewhere near my ankle.

“You’re late,” she scolds, hopping off the ladder. “Figured you’d ditch. Your kind usually does. No inherent decency to value another person’s time unless it turns a profit.”

“My kind?” I’m amazed by the civility I’ve managed to muster, having to deal with her pinko anti-capitalist rants about the utopia of communism – cleaning toilets for no money? Humans are animalistic. We’re designed to preserve ourselves, even if it means someone else collapses from exhaustion. Our inherent nature is to rip apart the weak and needy, because their vulnerability is a liability.

“Rich. Republican. Devoid of humanity.” She has that smirk. Holier-than-thou. Gives a child a Hershey’s bar once a year and thinks it makes her morally superior to the gluttonous wealthy.

“I was busy donating old mink coats to orphans of war criminals,” I say, playing with a lock of her hair. It smells of cedar and shampoo that costs $1.29. I pull a strand to my lips; she shivers exactly on cue. I yank on it. Just a little. Then hard. Rips clean out of her scalp. There’s a hushed yelp, muffled by the back of my hand. I smile.

Carol abandons Bowie for the jazz bin and composure. She pulls herself up, straightening her spine. “Still pretending you like Monk?”

“Still pretending you can play him on that Fisher-Price portable?” I counter. She bites her lip to hide the grin.

A flash of violent red catches my eye near the counter—Stephen. Hair like an electrical fire, oxford shirt tucked too neatly. He tries to return a Donovan LP; the cashier waves him off, uninterested. Stephen mumbles an apology, clutching the record like a wounded bird, and backs out of the store. I watch him longer than he realises. My hand itches to scrape his freckles off with a paring knife.

Carol notices my gaze. “You cheating on Hunter again?”

“Relax. He’s strictly background noise.”

“Cruel,” she says, half turned-on by it.

I loop an arm through hers and guide her toward the listening booth—a Plexiglas closet meant for shy freshmen discovering prog rock. Privacy in plain sight. The door clicks shut; the outside world fades under hissy speakers.

She leans back on the padded bench; I block the exit with a knee. One hand finds the underside of her jaw. I tug—gently—so her pulse beats under my thumb.

“Miss me?” I don’t know why I ask, it’s not like someone will ever say no. They’re grateful for being hung up on by me. Having my phone number at all is a privilege.

“Only when I breathe,” she murmurs, pupils huge now.

I taste her—quick, sharp, just enough to smear her ChapStick. She exhales against my mouth, almost a sigh that says we’ve done this before and we’ll do it again, no matter how many Sunday sermons you quote in public and homophobia you spew around your bigoted conservative friends.

A stack of unused demo sleeves sits on the shelf. I snag one, scrawl the instructions to get into the newly added guest wing and slide it into her jeans pocket.

“Tonight,” I say.

“Your place?”

“Where else would I keep the good champagne?”

She bites my lower lip, playful punishment. Then straightens her blazer, breath steady but eyes still stormed.

As we leave the booth, a poster on the corkboard flutters—the door’s draft, nothing more. It advertises a campus “Human Sexuality Symposium” with the tagline Know Thy Body. Carol smirks at me; I arch a brow. Neither of us tears it down, despite the degeneracy sending a wave of nausea through me.

She reaches the front first, pausing to pay for a battered copy of Hunky Dory. The clerk asks if she needs a bag; she says no, slides the record under her arm like it’s a certificate of poverty that she’ll take home with pride. I stifle the disgust. Not because she shops here — everyone needs their little rebellion, I mean, sometimes I read de Beauvoir when I’m bored — but because she enjoys it. Because she believes in it.

She thinks bad taste is proof of authenticity. That poverty makes people more noble, that war criminals and war heroes are the same thing. She once asked me to read The Female Eunuch while I was still bruised from horseback riding in Gstaad. As if Germaine Greer had ever truly understood female suffering. A white woman raised in Australia, complaining about the white men around her, while female children in the Middle East and North Africa are having their genitals hacked off by rocks and no anaesthesia so their husbands have one more ounce of pleasure thanks to a fistula.

Outside, the drizzle needles the sidewalk. Carol wraps her cardigan tighter — the kind made by a woman in a commune who thinks bathing is a government plot.

“One day your mother’s going to smell me on you,” she says.

I smile as I light a Capri.

Let her.

Carol marches against the Vietnam War and still sleeps soundly on imported Egyptian cotton. She thinks peace is holy unless America defends itself.

They all think that. The protestors. The professors. The priests. They’re pacifists until someone burns their church or rapes their daughter. Then they beg for men like my father.

“I doubt she’d recognise happiness if it clawed at her throat,” I reply. Neither would Carol.

Carol laughs again, softer now—an intimate password between conspirators. We part at the corner, her cardigan speckled with rain, my pulse sharp.

The bruise on her knee peeks through the hem as she crosses the street. I decide it needs a matching twin by morning.



CHAPTER THREE – TED


It’s too warm in here.

I crack the window but it doesn’t help. The air is still thick. Still her.

I don’t know her name. She never gave it. That’s the first thing. That’s power. She just smiled and walked away, like I didn’t matter. Like I was no one. Like I hadn’t made her laugh.

Like she hadn’t felt it.

I keep replaying it. The can of Tab soaking through her blouse, putting the double DD tits right on display. Her fingers on mine. That skirt. Jesus, that skirt. My eyes dipped and she let them. She wanted me to look.

And now—what? I’m supposed to go to bed and just forget?

She had these long legs, and a voice like fucking Grace Kelly. Not like the girls I usually meet at the Center. Not sweet. Not soft. Not manageable. Bitchy but not bitchy. I can only imagine what the cunt will be like. Tight, probably. Never let anyone inside it. Never birthed a child with a body like that. The kind of body that needs to be violated.

She’s not like Liz. Liz would never talk to me like that. Liz waits up when I’m late and rubs my shoulders and asks if I want cocoa. Liz lets me put it anywhere, even if she doesn't want to, actually - especially when she doesn't want to - and thanks me for it. Liz makes me feel—

I shouldn’t think like that.

I shouldn’t be doing this.

My hand’s already around it. I don’t remember when that started. But it’s there, and I’m picturing her mouth, those full lips, the come fuck me blue eyes. The way she smiled without meaning it. Like she knew something. Like she saw through everything.

I think she did. Like she knew what I was. She knew what I was, and she liked it. Or worse—was worse.

No. That’s not fair. I was charming. I was good. I made her laugh. I helped her. I touched her hand.

But she walked away.

They always walk away. She could’ve asked my name. She didn’t. She didn’t even look back. Like I was part of

the room, furniture, something cheap and optional. Rich broads think they’re above me, despite the tailored clothing, despite the gleam of my shoes.

I close my eyes and see her on her knees, that perfect hair a mess in my hands. The skirt hiked up. It should be me who decides when the voice goes. It should be me who chooses how she ends.

I won’t need her name when I find her again. She thinks she’s safe behind gates and family. Thinks men like me are afraid of the porcelain and ivory gates. But I've been in better houses than hers. I’ve walked into them with a crowbar and left with power usually associated with God himself.

I’ll make her give me something else.

And when she does?

She won’t laugh next time.


CHAPTER FIVE – CRISIS (Maris POV)

CHAPTER FIVE – CRISIS Maris’s POV

I consider taking the Porsche to the Seattle Suicide Crisis Centre, but I don’t like the odds of its survival in Capitol Hill — an area teeming with homosexuals, deviants, and anti-war protestors who enjoy the destruction of capitalism via keying and vandalising property they could never afford. My backup ‘72 Mercedes 280 CE can handle the abuse, so I wait for Luis to bring it around to the portico.

There’s a chill in the air — nothing I can’t handle — but it impedes my ability to wear my favourite backless Versace vest. Instead, I choose a tartan pleated miniskirt that shows just enough thigh without reading as a streetwalker. My calfskin oxblood knee-high boots complement the skirt with ease, and my blouse clings to my figure. It’s currently buttoned to the neck to bypass Quinn’s eye, but I have a feeling that in the presence of Ted, a little more skin just may show.

I’ve always been pleased with my skin. I never went through the embarrassment of pizza-faced Millie at thirteen, so my makeup collection is minimal — a hint of rouge, lip gloss, and a flick of eyeliner to frame the aquamarine.

I drum my fingers along to Rock ’n’ Roll Suicide — befitting and utterly hilarious. Pink Floyd follows. Then, the Flower Duet. Enchanting, especially when juxtaposed against the degenerates I drive by. Illegal aliens — mostly Mexicans — whose survival puzzles me, crossdressers in clownish makeup, and the general hoi polloi dressed in what look like garbage bags. Thank God I didn’t bring the Porsche.

I turn onto Pine Street, driving a block before spotting the four-storey Victorian mansion, desperately in need of a paint job. I park and lock the car, offering a warm smile to a questionable man passing by as I tuck my Hermès Constance securely beneath my arm. He has dreadlocks. Just looking at them makes me nauseous.

The receptionist stares at me with a cocktail of confusion, rage, envy, and disgust — the usual blend I elicit from women over thirty, whose prime is so far behind them they only feel safe in candlelight.

“Can I help you?” she asks, smiling tightly, her eyes begging to tear my hair out.

“My name is Maris Caldwell. I’m here to volunteer on the phones. My father arranged it with a Mr. Harris, I believe,” I say, matching her lips with mine. “I’m meant to begin at five.”

It’s 4:30. I want the lay of the land before the others arrive.

“You’re volunteering here? I’ve seen you in the society pages. Are you sure you’re in the right spot?”

“Painfully sure.”

“Uh, okay. Phone rooms are on level four. Bit of a walk. Hope your shoes don’t pinch.”

She wants them to.

“Thanks, Melinda.”

Her name badge says Melissa. Close enough. I like to make people feel noticed and disposable all at once.

The phone rooms are cramped, underfunded, predictably beige. A redheaded boy with overly bright green eyes and a little too much bounce tells me to take the centre seat. I’m handed a notepad, the rules — no swearing, tolerate it if you're sworn at — and a standard-issue pencil. Every pair of eyes is on me. I offer my rehearsed smile from childhood: warm, enigmatic, invulnerable.

He’s not here yet. Not due until six. But his name is on the desk beside mine. He’s meant to train me — despite Daddy and I lying about my experience in crisis centres back East.

The wait is agonising. I’ve never been known for patience. The humdrum voices around me blur into a soup of clichés. You’re not alone. This too shall pass. Permanent decisions, temporary problems. I’d argue most of them are incorrect. If you really wanted to die, you wouldn’t call anyone.

When he arrives, it’s almost a shock.

Ivory polo shirt, tan corduroy pants, same patent leather shoes from the lecture. His gaze drifts lazily until it locks on me. I watch his eyebrows twitch as he gnaws at his lip.

I rise and smile like I’ve been waiting for him all my life. I extend my hand.

He takes it, stares at it like he’s never seen one before.

“I know you from somewhere,” he says. One side of his mouth tilts higher.

“You saved me from a dehydration-fuelled death with a little brute force.”

I part my lips slightly, then go silent. Silence is the rope. I like to watch them tie their own knots.

“Ah, uh, yeah, I—I like to help women in distress.” He licks his lips. Hand to chin. Already squirming.

I gesture at the room. “Clearly.”

He laughs. I laugh back — real this time.

“I’m Maris, by the way. Maris Caldwell.”

“Yes, I do remember now — the Tab. You didn’t give me your name.”

“I did, Ted. Maybe you just forgot.” I smile just like he did. Let him doubt his own memory.

“But now you’re stuck with me. You’re meant to train me, but don’t worry — I’ve done this before. I’ll try not to be a headache.”

“There’s, uh, uh, not much to explain. Just convince them their problems matter, and they should stick around instead of chasing a box of paracetamol with a bottle of whiskey.”

“Exactly what I told Mr. Harris. He still insisted on training.” Total fiction. But Ted doesn’t need to know that.

“He’s a space cadet. I wouldn’t worry, uh, too much about him.” He combs a hand through his still-damp hair. He’s staring at my legs.

“Free reign around here.”

I take a sip of water. Unbutton my blouse. Just one. Casual. As though it’s not freezing in here.

He notices. Of course he does. But not his phone ringing.

“Ted? I think you’re up.” I nod toward the rotary phone on his desk, yellowed and on the brink of collapse.

“Let the, uh, uh, magic begin,” he says.

Ten minutes later, he’s still on the line. His voice is gentle. Soft. The same voice he used — I imagine — when luring a girl into the car, just before breaking her jaw.

He tells a woman her cheating husband isn’t her fault. That suicide isn’t the answer. That she matters.

My line rings. A woman has sliced her wrists — probably horizontally. They never get the direction right. “Sydney, honey, I promise it gets better.”

“I have nothing to live for. Rejected from every college. My parents hate me.” She sobs. “I should just give them what they want.”

She’s in the bath. The water’s apparently red. I doubt it.

“Sydney, sweetheart,” I coo. “You don’t know what the future holds. One rejection isn’t a death sentence. There are better colleges, better people. Don’t you want to prove them wrong?”

I feel Ted watching. I glance at him, play with the edge of my skirt. A twitch in his corduroy. He shifts.

She keeps sobbing. An hour and a half. The police trace the call. I stay on the line until I hear sirens.

“Trust the paramedics, honey,” I tell her gently. “They’ll take good care of you.”

I stretch, arms above my head. Let the skirt lift just enough. No underwear.

He’s transfixed. He’s on the line with someone named Nancy — something about assault. His voice is shaking.

My phone rings again. A man this time. Says he has a shotgun in his mouth. I use the script.

Then I reach into my purse. Pull out my Montblanc. Write a note. Slide it across.

“I’m fucking starving.”

He blinks. Smirks. Grabs a ballpoint.

“No lobster around here.”

“I know a place. Dinner after this?” I say, massaging my neck.

“Let’s do it.”


CHAPTER SIX – HER NAME IS MARIS (Ted’s POV)

I didn’t expect to see her again. Especially not here—not in this dingy little den of depression, rage, and gloom. I’m forced to be here. She isn’t. She should be back in her daddy’s mansion, living off the fruits of his labour while I scrape across town in a jalopy that could use a new engine and carpet upholstery. Bloodstains are hell to hide.

She’s wearing a top that clings to her. It’s cold in here—really cold—and she’s not wearing a bra. I can see that. She just sits there like perfection. A doll come to life. Untouched. Ready to be defiled and broken.

Her tits sit higher than they should for their size. Her legs are crossed—a challenge. Her skin gleams under the fluorescent lights that punish everyone else. She's smooth and sweet over the phone, voice like oxycodone. Soothing. Artificial. Addictive. But it’s the eyes that kill me. They should be looking up at me. Pleading. Tears.

I take calls. I end calls. I offer advice I don’t mean. I’m only here for course credit, padding for law school applications. If they want to hang themselves, they should. It’s a free country.

Then she looks at me—and I freeze. I stammer like a fucking retard. Because of her. This spoiled, perfect little bitch. She acts sweet and needy, innocent even, but I know she’s none of those things.

Women like her ruin men. Even men like me.

What does she expect a man to do when her nipples are poking through her shirt? Any red-blooded man would want to bend her over and break her. Rip her silk panties and eat until his face is soaked. Bite those glossy, long legs. She’s never been touched, that’s clear. That’s what gives her the confidence. If she knew what a real man was capable of, she wouldn’t walk around like this.

She laughs at what people say like it’s funny. It’s not. I can see the derision behind her eyes. She doesn’t blink. She stares. Her teeth sparkle when she smiles. I know there’s something demonic underneath, something not quite right. The rich boys orbiting her wouldn’t know it. You need acute awareness for that. You need to be a predator.

She unbuttons her blouse another inch, pretending not to notice my eyes burning holes through her. But she does notice. Of course she does. She feeds on it.

She’s doing it to torture me.

Fuck. I’d kill her if I didn’t want her so bad.

No. That’s not true.

I’d kill her because I want her.

That’s what no one gets. It’s not about sex. It’s about what comes after. When the thing is quiet and still and mine. When it stops talking. When it starts listening. When it goes cold and beautiful and obedient.

She wouldn’t be obedient, though. She’d smile as I did it.

I picture her begging me to be inside her. Then I picture snapping her neck and mounting her head on the wall.

She asks about my day like she cares. She doesn’t. But I talk anyway. I lie about pre-law. About helping people. About making a difference.

She nods like it’s charming. Then leans in—her perfume clinging to me in a way that makes it hard to breathe.

She stretches. Her skirt lifts just enough to show she’s wearing nothing. No full-coverage like a good girl. No lace thong like a spoiled one. Nothing at all.

I stiffen instantly.

I can almost see her cunt. Tight. Untouched. And the other hole—the one only Liz lets me use. The one I take from the others with force.

But Maris? No man’s touched her. She looks like the kind that makes them wait for months for a taste before flinching and flaking.

My palms are sweating. My brain’s a mess. She’s doing this on purpose. It’s freezing in here—she’s not undressing because she’s warm. She’s wrapping this whole thing in a bow and sliding it across the table, waiting to see who’ll bite first.

She slides me a note: “I’m fucking starving.”

I scoff internally and write back: “No lobster around here.”

She smirks. “I know a place. Dinner after we’re done?”

Who the fuck wouldn’t?

When the clock strikes twelve—on the Piaget at her wrist, no less—she stands, closes her notebook, and reaches for her bag. I try to get another glimpse under that skirt, but she moves too fast.

“You coming, Ted?” That smile. That fucking smile. Innocent. Soulless. Decadent.

I broke Diane. I can break her.

“Right behind you,” I mutter.

I wish I had a beer. Or reefer. Something to steady me. She’s in my head. Worse than that—she’s under my skin.

Then I see her car.

A fucking Mercedes. Not some dinged-up box on wheels like mine. It gleams. Leather interior.

“You wanna just take mine?” she offers, all honey and ice. “Might be easier.” Then, with a smirk: “Besides, I don’t know where I’d sit in yours. You don’t have a passenger seat.”

She’s baiting me.

“Yeah, uh—a buddy of mine used it to, uh, move some stuff. For storage. He’s moving house.”

She doesn’t press. Liz would. Maris just opens her door, gets in like she doesn’t care about the answer. I don’t know why it pisses me off so much.

Inside, her car smells new. Clean. Not a single stain. No wrappers. No cigarette burns, despite the pack I saw in her bag. She’s curated even this.

“Might wanna buckle up, Ted.”

When she starts the engine, I understand.

She drives like a lunatic. Runs red lights. Mounts curbs. Eyes on me instead of the road. Opera blasts from the speakers—I don’t know the name, I don’t know the language—it sounds like my life flashing before my eyes.

She’s doing 20 over the limit. Easy.

When we finally slam into the McDonald’s lot, my heart’s pounding. There’s a sheen of sweat across my face. My legs tremble.

“You always drive like that?” I ask, trying not to sound shaken.

She looks puzzled. “Like what? Come on. I’m hungry,” she pouts.

“I’m getting a cheeseburger, large fries, and a large strawberry milkshake. What do you want?” she asks, already in line.

“Uh… just a cheeseburger.”

“No milkshake?” she grins. “Don’t be boring.”

“Vanilla.”

I meet her eyes and immediately regret it. A war’s happening in my chest—half of me wants to bend her over the counter. The other half is still imagining her skull on my shelf.

She pays. Doesn’t even look at me. It burns more than it should. Liz bleeds me dry, but somehow this stings worse.

We get our food and slide into a booth. She doesn’t eat like a lady. Four fries at a time. Burger gone in three bites. Sucking her fingers for the last of the salt. Her lips are glossy from the grease.

Every bite, every lick, every smile—it’s killing me.

I’m fucking drowning.

CHAPTER SIX – CHÂTEAU CALDWELL (TED’S POV)

I clutch the edge of the Mercedes seat, fingernails digging into the upholstery, in disbelief that this girl—this spoiled little girl—drives so recklessly she might be the one controlling life and death. The engine hums beneath us, muffled by tinted windows, a trap she’s designed.

Maris drives neck-deep in power, her chin tilted—unflinching, untouchable. I study the line of her neck, too clean, too poised. Her hair sways with a precision that’s either divine or demonic. I want to steal that grace. Tear it apart. Piece by piece. Limb by limb.

The avenue is manicured within an inch of its life. Trimmed hedges, sculpted trees—gardens for wives who gossip over caviar and fuck the help by night. Even nature here has been put in its place.

She parks beside an electric gate. You hear the click before you see it—like a vault unlocking. The gate swings open, and I feel like I’m entering someone else’s zoo.

The courtyard gleams. Porcelain statues peer down like wardens. A fountain gurgles beneath filtered light. A white Rolls. A black Jaguar. A red Porsche with her name on the plates. I think about my jalopy. My piece of shit wouldn’t even make it past the curb.

She steps out—smooth, deliberate. I follow. Knees tight with shame. She opens the door and gestures like royalty. “After you.”

The foyer swallows me whole. Chandelier crystals drip like frozen rain. Marble stretches in every direction. The scent is jasmine and nothing else. I can taste the wealth, like oxycodone crushed under my tongue—sweet, quiet, addictive.

She leads me down a hallway lined with oil paintings. Old men in cravats. Women in gowns. A history curated to convince the world this family belongs here. I never belonged anywhere.

In a wood-paneled study, she presses a button and the wall opens. Shelves of liquor appear. Cognac. Scotch. Crystal decanters. Ritual, not just luxury. Obey, or be erased.

Then she turns slightly—just enough. She’s watching me. She knows exactly what she’s doing. She doesn’t pour the drink. She expects me to know my place. My fingers tremble on the cut glass.

"Walk me beyond," she says. Her voice low. No smile. I follow. Through another door. Another hallway. Then her wing. Her fucking wing.

Her bedroom is a cathedral. Canopy bed. Velvet curtains. Fireplace. A terrace. A pool lit like some kind of invitation, or punishment. I can’t tell which.

She moves like a little nymphet. Off come the boots. The skirt. The blouse. Nothing underneath. I knew it already—but knowing and seeing are two different beasts.

She watches me while she undresses. My face goes hot.

I should be angry. I should be dominant. But I’m not. I’m lit from the inside. Like a wire has caught fire in my chest.

Her eyes don’t offer anything. They challenge me. This little girl is trying to challenge me.

I want to fuck her. I want to break her down until her bones shatter. But I’m scared. Because if I try and she laughs—if I try and she wins—I don’t know what I’ll do.

I set the glass down. My hands shake. I step forward.

---

CHAPTER SEVEN: MARIS, DUCHESS OF BELLEVUE

He stares at me, mouth open slightly as I undress. He’s frozen, shocked. I feel warm under his gaze, not self-conscious. Powerful. The thrill of watching his restraint crack is intoxicating.

It almost looks like he’s afraid of me. Or like he wants to hate me and can’t.

“I’m going for a swim,” I say. “Are you coming?”

“I don’t have my swim trunks,” he replies, chewing his lip.

“Does it look like I’m wearing a swimsuit?”

His pupils dilate.

“You don’t need one.”

He swallows. Twice.

“I, uh… I think it might be a little cold. Maybe we could stay in here?”

“Suit yourself.”

I turn, head to the courtyard, and dive straight in. I need clarity. I need cold water, and distance from the heat building between us. Mother’s out cold on her usual cocktail. Daddy’s absent. Millie wouldn’t flinch if I were naked, bleeding, or on fire.

I do laps. The rhythm clears my head, but not my hunger. I want him. I want to own him. To destroy him. To make him feel small and addicted. I want what’s behind his eyes, if there’s anything there at all.

When I return to the bedroom, I hear the shower. He comes out in a robe, damp hair, boxers underneath. His stomach is absurdly defined. His posture uncertain.

I approach. He thinks he’s used to control. He isn’t. Not around me.

I kiss him softly. He grabs my waist, breath minty—he’s used my Marvis toothpaste.

He fumbles, trying to set down a tumbler, and I kneel before him. Water drips down my spine from my hair.

“I’ve never done this before, Ted,” I say, solemnly.

He grins like a boy.

I meet his gaze and lower his boxers. He groans as I take him in my mouth. One hand on my neck, the other threaded into my hair—not yanking, just holding. Like I’ll fall apart or break.

His breathing falters. He watches every movement like it might vanish. My hands move across his ribs, his hips, his thighs. He’s stunned. Like he doesn’t believe any of this is real.

Then he lifts me, lays me on the bed, parts my legs, and puts his mouth on me.

Hunter does it for show. Ted does it to consume.

I gasp. My back arches. I don’t recognize the sound I make, or the feeling tearing through me.

“What was that?” I whisper when I can breathe again.

He doesn’t answer. His fingers enter me. Then, finally, he does.

He kisses my cheek. My forehead. Brushes hair from my face. His eyes are focused—softer than I expected. Not savage. Just still.

I wrap my arms around him. I feel his chest against mine. His heart’s pounding.

When I say his name, he smiles. And when my legs shake, I wonder if I’ll ever recover from it.

He’s trembling, too. Just slightly.

Afraid.


CHAPTER EIGHT – THE CLONE (Stephen's POV)

The first time I saw her, I thought she was a hallucination. Not because of her beauty—though, God, there was that too—but because she didn’t belong. Not in this hallway, not in this city, not in any real place. She walked like she was followed by cameras. Like nothing could touch her unless she allowed it. I ducked behind the vending machine when she passed. I wasn’t ashamed of myself then. I am now.

She said my name once—"Stephen"—like it had always belonged to her. It echoed. I remember thinking I’d do anything to hear it again.

That was six weeks ago.

Now I’m at the Center every night. I volunteer for shifts no one wants—midnight to three, Sundays, holidays. I know her schedule. I learn her rhythms. Not intentionally, not at first. But the knowledge builds. Which days she brings Tab. When she wears perfume. When she doesn’t blink.

She doesn’t look at me much. But when she does, it hits like sunlight to the chest. Bright. Hurts a little.

Ted works here too. Everyone likes Ted. He has a way of taking up space without trying. Like he belongs everywhere. I don’t resent him. I study him.

The way he speaks—slow, deliberate, like his words have weight. The way he runs his hand through his hair when he’s thinking. I’ve started doing it too. Not obviously. Just enough.

Maris laughs at his jokes. Not mine. But I’m getting better. I’m learning timing. Cadence. I changed my cologne. Switched to his brand. I bought a pair of brown patent shoes like his. When I talk to callers now, I hear the resemblance. It comforts me.

Last week, someone asked if we were brothers. I almost cried.

Tonight, she brushes past me in the break room. No words. Just the scent of her. I grip the counter to stay upright.

Ted’s laughing with a girl—Pamela or Paula, something like that. She’s pretty. Blonde. But not the same league. Not the same species.

“Stephen, right?”

I turn. Maris is looking at me.

“Yes.”

Her head tilts slightly. Studying. Like she’s not sure if I’m prey or not worth the chase.

“You changed your hair.”

“I... yeah. Thought it might look uh—better.”

She nods once. “It’s cleaner. You shaved, too.”

My voice catches. “Did you... did you notice?”

She smiles. Not kind. But real. “I notice everything.”

Then she’s gone.

I stand there for a long time.

When I walk past the break room mirror, I don’t see myself. I see someone closer. Someone sharper.

Someone becoming.



LET THE GAMES BEGIN – TED POV I wake in an unfamiliar bed. It’s big, too big to be mine. I blink a few times, adjusting to the sunlight streaming in through bay windows, the glint of light bouncing off the pool. I didn’t see it last night; I didn’t realise she could host the Olympics from her back garden. I turn to where she’d curled up to sleep, laying on her front, the covers low enough to leave most of her bare. The skin was smooth, tight. Pussy? Pink. Untouched. Her mouth ready to be fucked. There’s something about a girl like that being on her knees for you. I did something to her. I didn’t even realise I could. I’ve never heard that sound from one of them, not even Liz when she pretends. I feel the smile creeping in, but it’s quick to vanish when I don’t see her in the room. I don’t hear the shower. There’s a tray at the foot of the bed with black coffee, croissants and French toast. Ice water with lemon. A little crystal vase with a white rose. I scoff. Even her breakfast is curated while the rest of us dump cereal into a bowl and fill it with the last of the milk in the fridge. I’m a light sleeper; vigilance is key. I don’t know when the tray arrived, and it creates a kind of restlessness. I sit up, careful not to disturb anything. She’s gone, but there’s no sound—no heels clicking, no whispering voices, no sign of movement at all. Just that breakfast tray.

A folded linen napkin rests beside the toast. I unfold it.

Underneath: a Polaroid.

Her. Kneeling. Naked. Hair cascading over her shoulders. Her back arched slightly, head turned, lips parted like she was about to say my name. Or spit it out. On the back,

in looping girlish script— not the same as her writing on that note. That note that crowds my brain, rattling it for fun. This note reads:

“Did you enjoy the view?’

My stomach churns. My pulse rockets. There’s a twitch under the covers, but my throat tightens. I look around. Did she take it last night? Before or after? Is this a joke? A gift? A warning?

She knows. She knows what gets me. She knows how I think.

It’s not just the photograph. It’s the staging. The control. She leaves a rose like she’s courting a Harvard girl. Leaves the note like it’s affectionate. Leaves the food like she’s nurturing me. But she’s not here. She’s already disappeared. She’s decided to abort mission before her family could tut.

I take a bite of the toast. It’s warm. Somehow, it’s still fucking warm.

I chew it down hard, like I’m eating part of her—trying to consume the control back. I sip the coffee, black, and it tastes like something I’ve always wanted – the life of the people who didn’t have to share scraps and fake ski wristbands because they couldn’t afford passes. Everything about her is expensive. Like she was bred for it. Born in a silk nest, elevated above the rest of us.

There’s something deeply, disturbingly wrong about how good that Polaroid makes me feel. It’s not arousal anymore. It’s not even possession. It’s… panic. Like she’s already cornering me on a chess board.

What did she say again?

“You don’t need one.”

No swimsuit. No warning. No protection. Just her, in full control, deciding when I enter, when I leave, what I’m allowed to remember.

I crush the photo in my fist. Then smooth it out. Then stare again.

I want to kill something.

No—someone.

A name rises. Brenda. The girl from the Flame. She was at the tavern last week, drunk off her ass, waiting for a ride. Easy. Stupid. Alone. Apparently she’s always there, waiting for someone to put her out of her misery.

And best of all—she’s not her.

That’s what I need. I need to kill the echo.

I need to burn the taste of Maris Caldwell from my fucking mouth.

She doesn’t call.

Not the next day. Not the one after. Not even when I walk by the Crisis Center and pretend it’s by accident.

I start leaving notes on my own windshield. I write fake numbers in my notebook and try to guess what hers might be. I call five Marises in the phonebook and hang up on all of them. One had a voice too sweet. One sounded old. One had a kid in the background and I wanted to vomit.

I try to fuck Liz. I picture the Polaroid and then I look at her. Her skin’s different. Everything is sagging just a little too much. The way her body has... lived.

I end up rolling off and pretending I’m tired. She asks what’s wrong. I say nothing. She says she loves me.

I think about breaking her neck right then. Not out of hate. Just to feel something.

---

I leave my blinds open in case she walks by. I position myself in the mirror to look better. Shirt off. Smile cocked. But hours pass. Days pass. It starts raining. I keep the blinds open.

---

On the fourth night, I dream she’s standing in my kitchen. Wearing the same skirt. Legs crossed, that notepad and Montblanc pen in her hand. She says something, but her mouth doesn’t move. I wake up sweating, hard, ashamed.

---

When I go to the Flame, the girl’s already outside. Alone. Her hair’s wet; sweat or rain, not that it matters – they all sweat eventually when they’re begging. Swerving a little on her feet, looking for someone to save her.

I realise that’s what they do. They look to be saved. And they don’t even know what they’re asking to be saved from.

I don’t smile at her. I don’t offer to help. I just tell her I’m going that way.

She gets in the car like it’s nothing. Like there isn’t a grave with her name already on it. All smiles, no questions. No awareness. Born to be prey. She doesn’t even notice that I

haven’t asked her for an address. She rambles it at me eventually, reeking of whisky and the faintest trace of reefer.

I make it a point to drive through her street, just to give her a little bit of hope. That there’s good in the world and she’s deserving of it. I think we both know she isn’t. None of them are.

She hasn’t noticed yet. Or maybe she has and she’s telling herself it’s fine, that it’s normal. That I’m just a guy helping out a drunk girl, not the monster her parents warned her about when she pretended to listen. I’m well dressed. I’m not a weirdo, a pervert of any kind. People wouldn’t be able to spot me as someone who’s a bum, a slacker that hangs around the bar scene. I’m chivalrous. My shoes shine. I help old ladies with their groceries. I volunteer at a fucking suicide crisis centre.

She starts to fidget. Her face is tense, but the polite smile remains. Women and their smiles. When they’re uncomfortable, when they’re praying for the better outcome, when they’re trying to hide their stress. It’s the most useless skill society has taught them. I wrote a guide on how to not get raped: kick, scream, fight, run. Instead, they acquiesce, cry, pretend to enjoy it or hide it behind one of those smiles.

“There’s a turnoff coming up,” she says, voice light. Casual. Like she’s not scared. She still thinks she can steer the outcome. She thinks her presence would be missed, despite having no one to pick her up from a bar. No one to check in on her to make sure she got home safe. What’s one face off the planet, anyway? Especially one who’s drunk, alone and ready to hop into a stranger’s car at 3 in the morning. The women’s libbers are great. Pussy on a platter, no questions asked.

“I know,” I reply.

I keep going.

That’s when the silence shifts. The tension mounts.

Her legs stiffen. Her hands tighten in her lap. She stops talking.

I pull into a clearing off the road—narrow, muddy, swallowed by trees. There’s no one for miles. Just pines, wet dirt, and the sound of her breath starting to quicken. Her face is devoid of colour. The smile has been wiped off.

“I think this is the wrong way—” she says, reaching for the door.

I grab her hair first.

It’s instinctive now. The second she thinks she can leave, I clamp down. My knuckles scream from the angle, but I don’t let go. Her skull thuds against the inside of the window and she yelps like a kicked animal. If I were out in normal society, I’d readjust my pants to hide the excitement from her cries.

Her fingers claw at me. She tries to talk. They always do. They never know the right time to shut the fuck up. Not Liz, not this bitch, probably not the next one, either.

She hits me in the cheek. Sloppy. Weak. Drunk strength is nothing. I hit her back, hard. Her mouth opens like she’s going to cry, but the sound doesn’t come out fast enough. I yank her out through the passenger door, and she tumbles like a rag doll, face-first into the mud. She tries to get up. I laugh.

I kick her.

Once. Twice.

Then she goes still.

Not unconscious. Just still.

I crouch over her. Rip her pants off. She is wearing underwear, the big baggy kind of Liz wears when she thinks I won’t come over. She’s shaking from the fear. She asks me what I want. I tear the panties off and she finds out. She screams like there’s someone within earshot, someone who’ll care enough to come and save her worthless existence. She doesn’t have a canopy bed to return to, a house that has an oil painting of her. Parents who’ll buy her multiple cars. She’s nothing.

Mud smears across her face, rain streaking her cheeks like she’s crying for God. There’s blood at the corner of her lip. One shoe is gone. Her jacket’s twisted halfway around her arms. I slide it off. She doesn’t stop me.

Her breathing is shallow.

“Please,” she whispers.

Please.

I fucking hate that word. I don’t know why they think it’ll work.

She’s still alive when I roll her onto her back and press my knee between her bare, slightly uneven breasts. Her body jerks but she’s all out of screams. The drunk ones scream less. They save their energy for begging.

I put my hands around her neck.

I can feel the panic in her pulse. Can feel her trying to push me off, that tiny bit of energy left to resist. I don’t let her. My weight bears down as I squeeze harder.

There’s a point in strangulation where they stop fighting and start sinking. Like drowning. Like surrender.

She hits that point. I watch the light leave her eyes. It’s my favourite part.

She goes limp.

I hold a little longer, just to be sure.

When I let go, her face is in the dirt. Her mouth open, slack, already caked with earth and blood. Her body twitches once—death spasm. I wait.

I wait for the disgust.

It never comes.

Instead, I feel… nothing. No guilt. No fear.

Only the faint, creeping echo of her laugh in my head. Not Brenda’s. Maris’s.

As if she’s here watching. Grinning. Applauding.

I glance down.

Brenda’s eyes are still open.

I don’t bother to close them.


CHAPTER NINE — THE VANITY OF HELL (Maris POV)

There’s a sliver of morning light cutting through the shutters like a scalpel. I let it. Natural light exposes more flaws.

My vanity is cluttered with carefully archived atrocities. A bone fragment the size of a sugar cube — boy, bookstore, greenhouse. Hair tied with a ribbon, washed and lacquered to preserve the curl. A matchbox with a name pencilled inside: Daniel, the first. Just Daniel. They didn’t bother looking for his last name. He didn't matter enough.

One drawer is filled with last words. Scribbled on napkins, receipts, hotel stationery — transcribed from memory or overheard in the last breath.

"You don't have to do this." "Please tell my mom..." "Are you... real?" I sort them alphabetically by tone: Fear, Begging, Confusion.

Another drawer contains photographs of men at their most grotesquely human — laughing too hard, crying over someone else, cradling babies. I keep them precisely because they were so alive. It's not enough to take life. I want to take joy. To kill the moment they believed the world still had something to offer them.

The third drawer — the most recent addition — holds mocking notes, photocopied and folded into pale pink envelopes. I send them postmarked from nowhere.

"He was smiling when he died. Isn’t that sweet?" "You should’ve told him not to trust pretty girls." "Oops." Typed in fonts that look like children's birthday invitations.

I reach for the Seattle Times, delivered like clockwork. I never miss an issue. It’s a habit that began in Switzerland, when I had to track obituaries for confirmation — and ensure no one ever found out.

I thumb through the Metro section while painting a thin streak of Chanel’s Vamp across my nails. The brush trembles slightly — not from guilt. From anticipation. There’s a little joy in the wait. Like opening presents Christmas morning, wondering which one might be mine.

Then I see it.

“Body Found Near Issaquah. Unconfirmed Identity.” A young woman, believed to be in her early twenties, was found dead in a wooded area

east of Seattle. The victim had no ID, but police are requesting assistance from patrons at the Flame Tavern, where she was last seen. The cause of death has not been released.

The corners of my mouth curl.

I don’t need a name. But the tavern? That’s Brenda. She giggled when I asked about her lipstick. She said she was going to dance until she couldn’t feel her feet. I guess she got her wish.

I lean back, one leg folded under me, robe slipping off my shoulder. The polish is drying. The page flutters slightly in the air current from the duct above. My room smells of Tom Ford and Marvis. Below the article, a cigarette ad. Above it, a recipe for coffee jelly. Someone’s mother will clip that for her scrapbook, completely unaware that her daughter’s killer read the same paper, hands still dirty.

I circle the article in red ink. Not because I’ll forget — because I want it to bleed into the page.

Ted. Predictable little thing. Couldn’t take the silence. Needed to feel in control again. But this wasn’t about her. This was about me.

I tap the bone fragment on my desk three times. Not superstition. Rhythm. Power. Three is always enough.

“Echoes don’t kill themselves,” I say. I see my smile in the mirror. Genuine for once.

Then I take a fresh Polaroid — from a different night — and scrawl in Millie’s handwriting:

“Was it as good for you the second time?”

I seal it in an envelope. No return address. No mercy.


HAPTER TEN – THE GOOD BOY (STEPHEN)

The Caldwell estate always smells like peonies. Not real ones. Just the kind rich people buy in perfume form and spray on everything—their couches, their sheets, their wrists when they want to look like they didn’t try. The thing is, with Maris, he know she isn’t trying. She doesn’t seem like she wants to even be here in the first place.

Stephen stands in the foyer, holding a bunch of ranunculi wrapped in wax paper. Not pink roses. He couldn’t afford those. He thinks maybe the gesture will land anyway.

Maris appears at the top of the stairs in a black silk robe, hair swept back with two silver clips. Her eyes flick to the flowers. Then back to him. No smile.

“You look tired,” she says.

He nods, suddenly self-conscious. “Didn’t sleep much.”

“Insomnia, or guilt?” There’s a smirk.

He doesn’t answer. Just watches her descend like she’s about to make a forced speech at a gala, a knife to her back. Her legs are bare. One toenail is chipped. He commits that to memory.

“I brought these,” he says, holding out the flowers.

Maris takes them with a strange look—somewhere between amusement and pity—and sets them on a side table without sniffing them.

“You’re early.”

“I—I thought maybe we could talk before…”

“Before I ask you to help me dig up a dead body?”

Stephen’s face flushes. “That’s not funny.”

“Isn’t it?” She walks past him, trailing silk and disinterest. “You never laugh at the right parts, Stephen.”

He follows her into the parlour. Everything is white and sterile and stunning. There’s a faint classical piano piece playing somewhere in the house. Debussy, maybe.

On the coffee table is a folded newspaper. The article circled in red pen:

Local Student Still Missing After Night Out – Foul Play Suspected

Stephen sits, hands clasped.

“I read about her,” he says quietly.

Maris glances over. “Brenda.”

“She went to UW. English major.”

“Not anymore.”

He swallows. “Did you—?”

“No.” A beat. “But I know who did.”

Stephen doesn’t ask.

She hands him a cup of coffee. Black, no sugar. He doesn’t like it that way but drinks it anyway.

“You’ve been dressing differently,” she says. “Tan shoes. Button-downs. Almost… Republican.”

He flushes again. “Just trying something new.”

“Is that what this is?” Her eyes land on him. Cool. Clinical. “Trying me on for size?”

“No,” he says too fast.

Maris smiles, slow and reptilian. “That’s what I thought.”

There’s a silence. Stephen fills it.

“Millie called me.”

Maris cocks her head. “Did she.”

“She’s… worried about you.”

“I’m worried about her waistline. Starting to look a little too doughy. Even for her.”

Stephen doesn’t laugh. He never does at the right parts.

Maris stands, stretches, glances out the window.

“The greenhouse needs tending. You up for it?”

He nods.

“Bring gloves. And don’t mind the smell.”

Stephen follows her again. Always follows.

And behind them, the newspaper remains open—Brenda’s photo grainy, her smile too wide. Just like the last one.





CHAPTER EIGHT – THE FIX Maris’s POV – 1974

It’s been six days. Six days since I let him inside me. Since I let my body respond like a woman. I’d thought I was above it — the moaning, the shaking, the warmth. But it happened. It happened, and worse: I enjoyed it. His mouth. His eyes, curious and confused, as though he didn’t know how he got there either — but I was the one who admitted it by asking the question. That’s what infuriated me.

Hunter’s fucked off to Acapulco with his friend Jack, a recent implant from San Francisco. I suspect he might be a little too camp, with how tight his trousers always are. As long as he takes Hunter off my hands and doesn’t send me anything viral from the homosexuals, I’ll tolerate it.

Millie is sulking, and there are no fresh wounds that need salt from my end. She’s not good for much else.

The house is quiet. Suffocating. Even Mother hasn’t come down for breakfast — likely passed out from her latest concoction of Chardonnay and Nembutal when Daddy’s put a little too much enthusiasm into one of his swings. I hope he learns soon to avoid the face. The Mozart vinyl skips upstairs, again and again on the same bar. She plays it in the mornings, pretending she knows the lyrics to Der Hölle Rache. It’s ironic, really. She plays that role in real life.

Outside, the hydrangeas are blooming. I hate the sweetness. It’s cloying. The humidity makes my legs sticky, and the itch starts to fester again. I’ve delayed it long enough.

There’s a thump at the front door. A boy.

Not much older than me. A university type — I mean, a really shit university, probably Puget Sound. Dark hair, corduroy slacks, leaflets for some co-op theatre production. His smile has too many teeth and the freckles across his nose give me the heebie-jeebies in the worst possible way. I try to conceal my disgust.

“I’ll only take a moment,” he says, the chirp of a children’s cancer fundraiser. “We’re running an all-girls Twelfth Night, if you can believe it.”

“I can,” I say flatly. “Women love pretending to be boys.”

He laughs, assuming it’s a joke. His eyes flick behind me.

“Your sister home?”

That’s when it clicks. He’s been here before. I answered the door then, too. But he wasn’t smiling. He was loitering on the footpath, asking for Millicent. Not me.

The tightness returns — a flicker, a spark, the itch roaring back to life.

I step back and open the door fully. “Come in,” I say. This time, I mask the glee. “She’s just down the hall.”

He follows. Obedient. Stupid.

---

Greenhouse

He runs his hand along a hideous potted fern. I lock the door behind us. Mother will likely be comatose, but just in case this one’s a screamer, I’m taking no risks.

“She’s not actually here,” I say. A guttural, very unladylike laugh escapes.

He blinks. “Oh?”

I pick up the pruning shears. Not the clean ones. The rusted pair. The ones with a hinge that sticks and a film of oxidised filth likely to carry tetanus.

“She’s not home. And I don’t like liars.”

“I—wait, I didn’t lie—”

“You asked for my sister.”

He backs up into the potting bench. Eyes wide. Too much blinking. “I didn’t mean— Wait, so you lied too?”

“Jesus, you really are braindead.” I tilt my head. “Not even pretty. You know that, right?”

This is going to be a mercy kill — for me and the world.

He raises his hands. Not in defence. Just confusion.

I slit his cheek from the corner of his mouth to the bottom of his ear.

He shrieks like a little girl.

Just for a moment.

I cover his mouth and drive the shears into his neck, through the side, twisting until sinew, artery, and tendon give way. He kicks once. Twice. Then slumps.

His body slides down the greenhouse wall like a vine that’s lost its stake. He pisses himself. Then comes the stench of death’s final insult.

I breathe. Steady. My blouse ruined. One drop of blood lands on my shoe.

I kneel beside him, studying the angle of his jaw. Millicent’s taste is truly abominable. She may as well work for that brothel downtown masquerading as a massage parlour so she can be paid for her charity work.

His last words? “Oh?”

I’ve seen better parting lines in dog food ads.

I don’t even bother with a Polaroid. Not yet.

But I’ll write it down later. Catalogue it. One more to file. The itch has subsided. Not gone. But quieter.

---

Later

I hide the body beneath some potted plants scheduled for “removal.” The gardener has appalling taste. I’m correcting it. Call it pruning the rot.

I leave the space clear. Stephen will need it soon.

Inside, Millie has finally emerged. Barefoot, pale, wrinkled nightdress. There’s a grape Popsicle in one hand and a jam smear across her front. She looks like a child dressed for trauma.

“There’s concealer in the vanity,” I say, walking past. “You look like you crawled out of a funeral parlour.”

“What’s that on your blouse?”

“Ketchup,” I say.

“Oh. You’re making sandwiches?”

“I made one. For myself. You need to cut back on calories.”

I pinch the flab at her lower belly. She yelps like a Beluga.

---

PRIVATE DRESSING ROOM – CALDWELL ESTATE – NIGHT

I keep them in a lacquered box. Blood wiped clean. Corners pressed flat. Paper thick enough for wedding vows or last rites.

Some are written in their own hand. Some by mine, faking the tremor.

“Please don’t hurt me.” I’ve underlined don’t. Then added in red ink: Weak negation. Consider stronger phrasing.

“I have a sister. Please—” That one’s my favourite. Not because it’s heartfelt. Because I circled have and scrawled underneath: Now had.

Each note is a monument to the moment I stopped pretending. I correct them because I can. They wasted their final breath on poor syntax. That deserves a second death.

The newest addition gets half a page. “Oh?”

That’s it. That’s all he managed.

I transcribe it in calligraphy. Then annotate beneath: Inadequate.


CHAPTER NINE – LAZARUS IN TRAINING Maris’s POV – 1974

He’s waiting outside the faculty library. Brown trousers, too short. Button-down shirt with the collar points curling up. A tan corduroy blazer, like he thinks it makes him look intellectual instead of ten years behind the curve.

He holds his books tight to his chest. Notebooks — plural. Spiral-bound, edges fraying. The kind of man who still uses pencils.

I watch him through the windshield. Engine off. A cigarette burning down to the filter in my hand. I don’t smoke, not really, but the ritual helps.

Stephen. He’s the perfect mark.

Too gentle. Too malleable. Raised on scripture and parental neglect. Just enough shame to make him useful. Just enough devotion to make him loyal.

I let him see me before I get out. I want him to notice the blouse — sheer, white, no bra — and the way my mouth moves when I pretend to smile.

He fumbles with his satchel. Stands as I approach. He always stands. Like I’m royalty. Like I’m going to knight him for remembering to breathe.

“Maris,” he says, voice low. Practised. “You didn’t say you were coming by.”

“I didn’t,” I reply. “I thought we might take a walk.”

He nods. Doesn’t ask where. Doesn’t care.

We stroll along the edge of campus, past a grove of chestnut trees shedding their skins. The concrete paths are littered with debris — petals, cigarette butts, soggy flyers for concerts that already happened. I imagine his room looks the same.

He talks too much. About philosophy lectures. About Proust and Jung and some obscure German essayist who “rewired his soul.”

I stop walking.

“Stephen,” I say. “Have you ever cleaned up blood?”

He blinks.

“I—no. I mean, not really. Not—uh—not human, if that’s what you mean.”

“What else would I mean?”

“I just—” he laughs, nervous, hands flitting like birds trying to escape his sleeves. “I cut my thumb once. In shop class.”

I nod, slowly. Step forward.

His breath hitches. I could kiss him and he’d faint. Instead, I reach up and fix the edge of his collar. Smooth it flat. Watch his pulse jump in his throat.

“I need your help,” I say. “There’s a boy in my greenhouse. He’s not doing very well.”

Stephen swallows.

“Is he—?”

“Dead.”

He doesn’t speak for a moment. His fingers twitch. Then:

“Okay.”

That’s all. No questions. No protest. Just okay.

I smile. Take his hand.

“Good. I knew you’d be my Lazarus.”

He looks confused. He always does. But he walks with me anyway.

---

The greenhouse is quiet. The stench has started to set in.

Stephen gags once. Twice. I hand him a linen handkerchief soaked in Eau Sauvage. Daddy’s favourite. I knew it would come in handy.

He doesn’t ask who the boy was. Doesn’t want to know. He rolls up his sleeves like we’re about to garden.

“I’ll need blood,” I say. “Yours. A drop or two.”

He looks up. Eyes glassy. “Why?”

“For the scene. For the story.”

He nods. “Right.”

And slices his palm open without blinking.

---

Later, I bandage him. The cut isn’t deep, but it’s enough. He looks at me like he’s done something heroic. Like he’s earned my approval.

“You’ve done well,” I murmur.

He beams. That stupid, needy, boyish beam.

I wonder how long it’ll take before he stops smiling altogether.



THE GAMES SCENE: EARLY JUNE 1974 – TED BUNDY’S ROOMING HOUSE, SEATTLE First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The envelope arrives in the afternoon mail. Thick paper, something Liz would yap excitedly about for the upcoming engagement that she thinks will eventuate. Nixon has a higher chance of re-election than me standing at the altar with her.

There’s no return address. No stamps, either. Just my name — scrawled across the front in tiny, perfect cursive.

Not Bundy, the name of my illiterate stepfather slapped on me. Cowell. The name I was born with, despite my mother trying to offload me onto an adoptive family. The name of my grandfather who insisted I be given a home where I belong.

The breath catches in my throat, searing in a way I haven’t experienced in almost a decade. My eyes dart across and around the porch to see if someone’s watching. There’s no one. Not Freda, not Liz, not the guy across the hall who doesn’t notice when I’m dragging a co-ed in a sheet from my bed to the bug. Just the landlady’s smug poodle in the window and the tree branches whipping above the picket fence.

Inside, the envelope is lined with wax paper. I saw it often when I worked for the medical supplies factory, so long ago now that it feels like a past life. I don’t know why my hand trembles as I pull the contents out. Bracing like I’ve swallowed something and it’s blocking my throat. A folded strip of yellowed newsprint comes out first.

It’s a Nancy comic. Sunday edition. November 24, 1946.

My birthday. Unwanted.

I hold it between my fingers, scanning the panel. Nancy’s feeding a bird. Sluggo’s chasing a cat. There’s no note, no message — but the meaning is carved into the edges. The day I was born. The name that came with my illegitimacy.

I know who you are. She’s trying to intimidate me. Trying to show me her money buys something I’ll never have – protection from the law and a bloodline that can be traced. She has a father who wants a relationship with her. Mine clearly didn’t. Not that anyone’s been forthcoming enough to tell me who he was in the first place. Rumours have swirled. I’m a bastard child. Potentially the product of violent incest. A sailor

knocked up the mother I believed was my sister. The immaculate conception? If it were good enough of a theory for the Bible, it’s good enough for me.

Under the comic is a small plastic bag. Inside it, something calcified and off-white rattles softly. A baby tooth.

My stomach lurches. It couldn’t be mine. I don’t think they cared enough to keep any of my teeth when they fell out. My aunt used to lock her bedroom door when I was little. Claimed there was something wrong with me because I found it funny to position the kitchen knives around her while she slept. It was just a fucking joke.

I flip the envelope inside out. Nothing else. No fingerprints. Just that name again. Cowell.

I study the tooth. It’s smooth, bloodless, aged. It’s human. I’ve taken enough teeth out of animals to know the difference. Enough out of girls to know which come willingly. Probably a molar. There’s a faint root still attached.

There’s a current of nausea. She’s trying to get into my head, under my skin. She wants me to punish her. She’s undermining my manhood because I gave her pleasure. Because I didn’t slam her against the bedside and make her bleed instead of climax. As if I wasn’t beating myself up over it already, she wants to drive the knife in.

I lurch to the sink and vomit bile into the drain, the stench of his rage and panic coating the porcelain like bleach. I grip the edge with both hands, knuckles pale. My skin is tingling with what feels like humiliation. This is the version Diane saw before she ran. Women search for the wounds and stick their little manicured fingers in to play, exacerbate, reprimand. There’s no mercy. No soothing, no gentle words to offer. Just cold calculation, tutting, rejecting, shaming.

The mirror above the sink shows a pallid version of me. Another version I don’t want anyone, particularly a snooty bitch like her. I’m sure she’s salivating at the thought of it, forgetting I conquered her, even if it didn’t break her bones and knock teeth out. Most women try to conquer in return with words – Liz when she tries to make me feel better after failing to get it up for her, Diane when she told me I was too immature for her - but this one’s trying to use symbolism. Something that’s harder to silence.

She’s almost inside me now. Burrowed into the part of my brain that still prays at Christenings after dismembering a girl.

I smoke enough reefer to take out a family of four, but sleep eludes me.

---

CHAPTER TEN – LIZ Seattle – Early June 1974 First Person – Elizabeth Kloepfer

He didn’t come to bed last night. The covers on his side are still perfectly smooth, still tucked. I waited for the creak of the steps, the click of the door — something. But the only thing I heard was the refrigerator hum and my own heartbeat, which is always louder when he’s not here.

I find him in the kitchen, slouched over the sink with the window open, shirtless. His skin’s pale, even in the morning light, like he’s been drained of something I don’t have a word for. There’s a bitter smell I can’t place. Not sweat or cigarettes. Something metallic, like the inside of a wristwatch.

“Hey,” I say, softly. “You didn’t come up.”

He doesn’t look at me. Just flicks ash from a cigarette into the sink and shrugs.

“I had things on my mind.”

My stomach turns. I know better than to ask what things. Whenever I try, he shuts down. He makes a joke or changes the subject, or worse, tells me I wouldn’t understand.

“Did you get my note?” I ask. “I left it on the nightstand. About dinner this weekend with Carol and her husband. He’s a dentist.”

He snorts. “Sounds riveting.”

I wait for him to smile. He doesn’t. I move closer and touch his back — lightly, right between the shoulder blades. He stiffens.

“You’re cold,” I whisper.

He finally turns. His face is drawn, jaw tight. The cigarette trembles slightly between his fingers, though he’d never admit it.

“Don’t touch me right now, Liz.”

I pull my hand back like I’ve been burned. My chest aches, but I nod. It’s easier than crying.

“Okay,” I say. “I just… I didn’t sleep much.”

He tosses the cigarette into the sink, not even stubbing it out, and moves past me toward the stairs. I follow with my eyes, noticing a small smudge of something dark near the hem of his jeans. Dried? Maybe. It could be oil. Could be anything.

“You forgot your coffee,” I call after him, trying to sound normal. Warm. Like I’m not wilting.

He pauses halfway up the stairs. Turns just enough to say, “I didn’t forget. I don’t want it.”

The door slams behind him.

I sit at the table alone, stirring the coffee he didn’t drink. The Nancy comic from yesterday’s paper is still sitting under his copy of The Seattle Times. He hates those comics — always said they’re for simpletons — but something about it makes me pick it up.

Nancy’s smiling. Sluggo’s chasing a butterfly.

For some reason, it makes my hands shake.



SCENE: EARLY JUNE 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, PRIVATE DRESSING ROOM First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

I lay the Polaroids out on velvet. One by one, like tarot. Here’s the first: me on my stomach, head turned, lips parted. You can’t see my face, not clearly. Just the slope of my waist and the ridgeline of spine, soft against sheets. The light is from morning. The implication is from night.

I sign the back in Millie’s handwriting.

"Do you miss home?"

I don’t think he’s told Liz yet. He’s likely pretending nothing happened. Most men do. Especially when they know they were the one who was conquered. His pride has already curled up into something small and despondent — and I’m only just beginning.

The Nancy comic had the right effect. The tooth even more. It took me three tries to find the right one — small enough to pass for a child’s, old enough to carry that particular patina of death. A family friend’s dental practice was most helpful. He’s been sleeping with his receptionist, and doesn’t want her to know about the inheritance clause in his marriage contract. Easy leverage. I offered discretion in exchange for discarded samples. It’s amazing what men give up when they think you’re a harmless little girl with a soft voice and a tight waist.

The next one is harder. Not emotionally. Logistically. I tuck the Annmarie photograph into the second envelope. Original, not a copy. That’s important. I want it to feel rare, irreplaceable. Like memory. Like truth. I tape the note on the back so he has to turn it over. Annmarie. Ever wonder? I consider underlining it, then decide against it. No need to shout. Whispering is always more effective.

There’s no return address, again. Just his birth name. Cowell. The name his mother tried to scrub out of the ledger. The name he pretends not to flinch at when he hears it. I underline it — once. Not twice. One underline is intimate. One says I know you.

In the mirror, I look like a painting. The robe is wine red, my hair braided down my back, a sliver of blood drying under one nail from the greenhouse. I haven’t washed it yet. I like the feeling of residue. Of something left behind.

Behind me, the jawbone mirror catches my reflection from another angle. A girl stitched from other people’s endings. That’s all I really am, isn’t it?

I light a stick of sandalwood and press the envelope closed with a drop of sealing wax. Red, of course. The colour of shame. The colour of birth.

He’ll vomit again. He’ll scream — but only inside. He’ll convince himself it was never real. Then remember it might have been. Then crumble beneath the maybe.

And that, I think, is the purest kind of torment. The unconfirmed. The unprovable. The what if I did?

I dust the wax with a trace of powder so the envelope doesn’t stick to the inside of the box, and ring the bell for the maid. Let her deliver it. Let her hands be the final link between my world and his ruin.

Then I sit back down at the vanity, lift my pen, and begin editing the next set of last words.



CENE: JUNE 1974 – TED BUNDY’S ROOMING HOUSE, SEATTLE First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The second envelope is heavier. I know before I even pick it up. There’s weight inside. Not just physical. Something else. Something intentional.

It’s addressed the same way — that same pretty cursive, like something from a debutante’s calling card. But this time, the “Mr. Cowell” is underlined. Just once. Not twice. A single underline, like she knows. Like she’s correcting the narrative with power she doesn’t have. A pretty little girl with a God complex who thinks she’s putting the fear into me by accessing information that is publicly available. She’d be better off sending me a pair of socks. If she really knew me like she thinks she does, that would be the more fitting option.

I close the door softly, locking it behind me. I carry it to the kitchen counter, where Liz sometimes leaves notes about milk and pickles and other things I don’t read.

I don’t open it right away. I’m not on her schedule. I’m not under her control, not even in her delusional little head. Her narcissism is her ultimate crutch. I make a pot of coffee. I smoke a cigarette. I clean my nails. I’ve been chewing on them more than usual. I don’t know why. And all the while, it sits there, pulsing. Trying to threaten me. Trying to get a rise out of me. Putting me in my place.

When I finally slice it open with a bread knife, something slides out.

A photograph.

Color. Glossy. A little girl — eight, maybe. Blonde ringlets. Blue dress. The kind they make for their stupid Easter recitals. Liz and I shopped for Molly’s. This girl’s holding a plastic wand. Smiling too wide for the camera.

I turn it over.

Annmarie. Ever wonder?

My lungs feel tight, throat constricted. Perspiration begins to form.

I sit down. No, collapse. My knees hit the chair edge and knock it sideways before I can steady myself. The photo trembles between my fingers, and for a moment, I’m eight again — hiding behind the garage in Philadelphia, watching something I wasn’t supposed to see. My mother screaming. My grandfather raging. The belt.

Ever wonder.

The words sear into me like scripture. She knows. She knows about the rumors. About Annmarie Burr — the girl who vanished from her bedroom in ‘61 when I was just a teenage boy with no car, no criminal record, just a head full of fantasies and a drawer of Playboy and detective magazines. Nylon stockings had become my favourite things to collect.

No one ever proved anything. Not in Tacoma. But I’ve wondered.

More than once.

Because there were hours I couldn’t account for. Because there was dirt under my nails that night. Because it was so easy. She liked me. Girls my age didn’t. Because she would smile at me during the day. And because I was so angry I couldn’t sleep.

Because I kept dreaming of her after she disappeared — barefoot in the snow, calling my name. And I’ve never told anyone.

Until now, I thought it might’ve been a dream. Or a lie I fed myself. But this girl — this rich little sadist is trying to fuck with my head. She’s trying to claw her way in, trying to collect memories to haunt me with. She’s sending me ghosts. Ghosts that I’m not sure I’m even responsible for. I was just a normal boy. I wasn’t a monster. I went to church every Sunday. There were meals at the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I took care of my siblings, no matter how much I didn’t want to. I hated most of them, I hated them taking my mother from me. I hated having to share an uneducated and underprivileged father. But I did what I had to, honouring my duties. The little girl on my paper route wasn’t one of mine. She couldn’t have been. I was a teenager.

I drop the photo. It flutters to the floor like a dead bird. I try to stand, but my hands are shaking too hard. My stomach tightens — not nausea. Dread.

This isn’t like the comic. Or the tooth. This isn’t symbolic. This is personal. Intimate. This is someone crawling into the deepest, blackest part of me and lighting a match. But it can’t be right, can it? This didn’t start until much later. She’s trying to destroy and corrupt the one thing I can cling to for a semblance of normalcy, safety. I was a happy child. I didn’t do this. I didn’t. I couldn’t. I wouldn’t. Not a little girl. That would be depraved, sick. Evil befitting the names my aunt Julia and th

could be anyone. She could’ve found that photo in a thrift store. She could’ve typed those words herself. That girl might not even be real. I didn’t do anything. I couldn’t have. I was just a boy. Boys do stupid things.

Maris doesn’t want to scare me. She wants to remind me. Of what I am. Of what I might’ve done before I knew what I was doing. Potentially rewriting my history. Before I had names for the urges. Before I had the Volkswagen. Before the headlamps and the hacksaw.

Before I perfected it.

She wants to say: You’ve always been this way. But I fucking haven’t. I was good.

And worse — she wants to say: So have I. I heave into the bathroom sink and then smash the mirror.



SCENE: JUNE 1974 – UNIVERSITY DISTRICT, SEATTLE – OUTSIDE A BOUTIQUE BOOKSTORE

Maris POV – Present tense

I don’t notice him at first. That’s the worst part. It’s been weeks since I touched him, tasted him, let him take something I never meant to give. And now he’s here — gaunt, jittery, not even trying to look casual in that wrinkled sports coat and desperate little stance. Like a boy who’s just seen his ghost. A part of me wants to soothe him. The same part that’ll dig the knife in again. His cheekbones are looking sublime, so clearly, it’s had somewhat of a positive effect.

I flick ash from my slim Capri cigarette and step sideways to let a woman in a beret pass. “Ted,” I say, as though I’ve just remembered his name. The beret is bothering me. The woman’s face is too fat to pull it off. It’s a distraction I don’t need.

He looks like he hasn’t slept. Or eaten. Or blinked. Ted and Quinn might’ve shared a cell in Auschwitz.

“I was beginning to think you left town,” he says. His voice cracks halfway through. I tilt my head and smile at the sound of it.

“I did,” I lie. “Briefly. Geneva.”

His eye twitches.

I stroke his cheek lightly. “Didn’t you get my note?” It’s lilted. Playful. There was no note. There were Polaroids. Me. Bound. Gagged. Posed. Material that carried prison time to possess, as well as the social weight of degeneracy if found. Material that he no doubt used for his self-pleasure in Freda Rogers’ rooming house on 12th Ave, thought about when he tried to get hard for Liz.

He tries to piece something together, but I watch it slip through his fingers.

“I missed you,” he says.

“I tend to hear that a lot,” I reply, kindly. “I do quite a bit of charity work.”

His breath catches. I exhale smoke.

“What was it, really?” he mutters. “Some kind of game? A dare? Was it because I—” He doesn’t finish the sentence. There’s a knowing smirk. Because I made you come? Because you liked it? Because you cried afterwards? It feels like I’ve been slapped. Heat rushes to my cheeks. “I think I just wanted to see

what it felt like,” I say, stepping past him, trying to contain the humiliation. “And now I know.”

But I don’t leave. I stop. Turn. Let him see me think — or pretend to. Like I might offer another taste.

“Come to the suicide centre tonight,” I say flatly. “If you want to talk.”

He nods before I finish the sentence. I feel his gaze as I slip into the Carrera – not sure whether it’s me or the car he’s coveting more.

---

SCENE: LATER THAT NIGHT – SUICIDE CRISIS CENTRE Third Person Limited – Ted Bundy’s POV

He’s already waiting when she arrives — not a second late, of course, because that would mean giving him control. She wears the same blouse she wore the night he touched her. There’s still no bra beneath it. If he were one step behind her on the creaky stairs, he’d see what he conquered. She knows it. He knows she knows it.

She barely acknowledges him. Sits. Opens a folder. Starts reading the intake form for a girl who called three times in tears but wouldn’t leave her name.

“Maris,” he says finally. “What happened?”

She looks up. Her face is unreadable.

“There’s a girl missing,” she says instead. “Six blocks from here. Lynda Ann Healy. Pretty. Blonde. Broadcast major. Lived in that green house near campus — you know, the one with the red door and the dumb bicycle out front.”

Ted says nothing. He remembers the door.

“She did morning ski reports for the college radio station. Ever hear her voice? It was soft. Clear. Very… soothing.”

She lets the word hang like perfume.

Then: “I used to see her sometimes. Walking to the station with her clipboard. Always punctual. Always polite. And she had that bedroom in the basement. Where they found the blood. You know what’s odd, though?” She pauses briefly, a little smile appearing.

“Lynda never made her bed. The day she was taken, though, her bed was made with surgical precision.”

His stomach clenches. So does his jaw.

Maris tilts her head. “You didn’t take her, did you?”

He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.

“I’m joking,” she says flatly, no hint of laughter. “You’re not that kind of man. You couldn’t.”

And she turns back to the file.

SCENE: JUNE 1974 – TED’S ROOMING HOUSE, SEATTLE First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

She knows. Of course she knows. She has the money to know, taunt and smirk. She can sniff around, play doctor and detective because she doesn’t need to work. She’ll never need to work and she loves rubbing it in my face.

I slam the front door too hard, and it rattles the frame, but I don’t care. The neighbour’s cat darts down the steps like a fucking hurricane about to hit. Good. I hate that thing.

I pace the kitchen. I don’t take off my coat, I don’t even remember putting it on. I don’t turn on the light. I’m still wearing the same shirt from the centre, and I can smell her on it. Her perfume — bergamot, maybe. Something expensive. Something unearned. I slam my fist against the cheap linoleum countertop.

“She wore that fucking blouse on purpose,” I mutter. “She wanted me to look.”

And I did. God help me, I did. I saw the tits. I saw the body I defiled, even if it wasn’t exactly the way I’d hoped. When I replay it in my mind, I’m throttling her, dragging her by the silky hair she parades around. She walked in like nothing had happened. Like I wasn’t the man who had been inside her. Like she didn’t cry when she came. Like I was nothing.

But she knows. About Lynda. About the blood. About the bed being made – hell, fuck me for thinking she was an orderly person who didn’t leave her room in chaos. I even hung her nightdress up, assuming she’d do the basics. I didn’t take her for a pig. That’s what the cops and this cunt have homed in on? I think of my hand closing around Maris’s dainty neck. The life draining from her eyes. The smirk wiped off permanently. Silenced.

She’s not just a pretty ornament. She’s a problem, a sadistic menace. Like a cat playing with a bird it hasn’t decided whether to kill. And me? I’m bleeding in the beak.

I flick on the hall light. Liz left a note — “milk, eggs, toothpaste.” I rip it off the fridge and crumple it.

“She thinks I took Lynda.” I startle myself when I realise I’ve said it out loud. The girl’s name. I’ve never acknowledged it. I smiled when I first heard it on the news. Again, when I saw it in the papers. But I never used it. It was never in my mouth. She was just a face, a prototype. Maris said it sweetly, like a girl offering a boy a piece of gum. But it was a revolver. And I let her load it. I almost confessed. Almost bragged to convince her I could. Like a child.

I grab the car keys. The yellow Bug is parked out back, and I don’t care if the engine screams. I don’t care if the cops pull me over. I need out. I need to erase this feeling — the burn of her eyes on me, the shame of being toyed with. There’s only so much nagging, hysteria, judgment and scrutiny a man can take from a woman. They need to understand consequences, punishment, silence.

SCENE: HOURS LATER – 5517 12th AVE NE – THE GREEN HOUSE WITH THE RED DOOR I park around the corner. It’s 2:17 a.m. The windows are dark.

There’s tape across the basement entrance. The police already came and left. They took her mattress. There wasn’t a body, so no fingernails to be scraped for evidence. They don’t know what they’re looking for. She could’ve been just another flighty runaway, hitching a ride to somewhere warm. Maybe a secret boyfriend.

I stand across the street, hands in my coat pockets. I stare at the red door until my eyes blur. I see her again. Lynda. Carrying her clipboard. Waving to the janitor. Telling a joke I didn’t hear.

I waited that night. I waited until the other girls were asleep. I slipped in like it was my own house, padded softly across the floor. I remember the scent of Suave shampoo. The heat of her scalp when I pulled her hair. The way her lip split when I slammed her head into the wall.

She never screamed. Not once.

And now Maris is using her name as a threat. Like a trapdoor she expects me to fall through.

But I already did. I did that in February.

I lean against the lamppost and light a cigarette. There’s a shadow in the upstairs window — just a silhouette. Probably another girl. Another stupid coed who thinks doors are enough. Time passes, she’ll forget. She’ll resume her life, blissfully ignorant to the men waiting to rip her apart.

I watch her undress from the street. Like I used to. She doesn’t close the curtain.

SCENE: LATER THAT NIGHT – TED’S ROOM – SITTING ON THE FLOOR I find the old envelope. The first one Maris sent. The comic. The “Mr. Cowell.” I rip it open again. Read it again. Read it like the New Testament on Sundays.

She thinks she has the upper hand. She thinks I’m losing it.

Let her think that. Let her play her games like a petulant child. Nancy comic panels. Baby teeth. Polaroids that I jerk off to. Names of girls who belong to me and others who don’t.

Let her mock my mother, my upbringing. Let her say the name Burr. Let her walk like nothing affects her. Because next time… Next time I’ll pick one with long dark hair. Just like hers. Next time I’ll take something back.

Next time, I’ll keep the body. Just for a while. Just long enough to make her jealous.



SCENE: JUNE 1974 – UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON CAMPUS – DUSK

Third Person Limited – Ted Bundy’s POV

I see her before she sees me. These girls are too stupid to understand vigilance. It’s blaring at them all day, women are vanishing into thin air around them, yet they walk around carefree, laughing, enjoying their potential last moments. The girl — Georgann — is walking with a friend outside Clark Hall, gesturing wildly about some test she flubbed, her voice too bright for the hour. It’s dusk. Mosquitoes swirl under the amber glow of the streetlamps, my blazer itches. She’s got that coltish, unassuming gait. Her legs are long. Her shoulders a little hunched. The kind of girl who thinks she’s not pretty, walking with a certain level of insecurity, unsure if people are looking at her with desire or pity.

I smile.

She’s perfect. Oblivious, submissive, easily managed.

I don’t trail her yet. I’m just watching. Recording her rhythm. I swallow a laugh when she trips over her laces. One-two. Left foot slightly turned in. A small favour from the gods. She’s a limper. I have a thing for limpers. They move slower during the chase. They usually have the endurance for multiple rounds.

I exhale into my jacket sleeve, adjust the collar, and step back behind the vending machine. Waits until the friend is gone — waved off with a chirp and a backward hug. Georgann checks her watch. She’s alone now. Sunset bleeding into night.

Then comes the voice.

“I thought you were taking Chinese.” Firm, but playful.

I turn. Maris is leaning against the brick wall of the adjacent building, arms folded, hair swept up. She looks delicate, fragile even, with her rail thin arms and graceful posture. She bats those big blue doe eyes. Her blouse is open enough to show the freckle above her sternum — the one I kissed the night she was mine.

She’s smiling, but there’s no joy in it.

“I was,” I lie, heat swelling in my chest. “Dropped it.”

She cocks her head, her lips just slightly parted. “Why?”

“I didn’t like the instructor.”

“That’s not what your transcript says.” She lifts something from her purse — a Xeroxed page. One of his college records. Course withdrawal in 1972. Chinese language, 101. Grade: Incomplete.

My throat tightens. My tongue catches on my chapped lip.

“I have access to certain archives,” she says smoothly. “You’d be amazed what turns up if you know which deans to flirt with.”

I step closer, look down to meet her gaze. “Are you stalking me now?”

She laughs. Not cruelly. It’s almost camaraderie.

“No, Ted. I’m leading you.” Then she glances over her shoulder — toward the retreating figure of Georgann Hawkins. “You like them docile, don’t you?”

He flinches.

“She walks like a baby deer,” Maris says, arms folding over her chest, blocking my view. “Easy to startle. Easier to take down.”

“Stop,” I say. There’s a flurry of feelings: arousal, anger, hunger, and confusion. “Don’t—”

“I bet she even calls her dad ‘daddy.’” Maris steps closer, her perfume threading through the cooling air. “You won’t kill me. You don’t know how. You know I’d be too difficult, wouldn’t let you get the kind of pleasure you want. But you can kill her, she’s pliable.” She leans in, whispering now. “Do it before finals. Her body won’t be found until summer’s over.”

My mouth is dry. Pulse roaring in my ears. I want her mute, kneeling, gagged, pleading — but not yet. Not while she thinks she’s running this show.

She turns to go. “You’ve got about ten minutes before she rounds the alley. The one behind the lecture hall. No one’s there after dark.”

I don’t pursue immediately. I stand frozen, vibrating, breath shallow — erection pressing against the zipper of my slacks. She gave me the idea.

No. She gave me the excuse.

They’d look. Daddy would make them. He’d find you, make sure you never see the light of day. He would get to you before the cops and your limbs would be spread across Taylor Mountain like Lynda’s. But you can kill her. She hasn’t been relevant since her daffodil princess days. People will miss her, sure, but give it a week, maybe two until they forget.” She leans in, whispering now. “Do it before finals. Her body won’t be found until summer’s over.”

No. She gave me the excuse. The idea was all mine. She doesn’t get to take credit for it.


SCENE: JUNE 1974 – ALLEY BEHIND LECTURE HALL – NIGHT First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

She’s just where Maris said she’d be. Ten minutes, almost to the second. She’s said goodbye to her frat boy and is almost at her sorority door. Georgann rounds the corner, a textbook clutched to her chest, holding out a single paper — probably her Spanish notes. Her lips are moving. Rehearsing. Like the exam will save her.

She’s muttering “ser, estar,” flipping between verb tenses like it’s the most important thing in the world. I wonder if she prayed this morning. I wonder if she knows she’s about to become part of my timeline.

I duck behind the stairwell and wait.

Her steps are light. She’s humming.

When she’s close enough, I stagger into the path, clutching my leg. “Hey, miss — sorry — can you help me get to my car? Crutches slipped.”

She startles, but not much. Girls like her — Catholic, helpful, nice to a fault — they never want to seem rude. She peers at me with concern, eyes wide, too wide, then nods.

“Yeah, of course.”

I hobble, feigning pain. She loops her arm under mine, petite and soft and utterly convinced she’s safe. We make it halfway to the darkened side of the lot when I pause, let my weight drop — like I’m weak.

She stumbles with me. That’s when I take the pipe from the bushes.

The first hit lands behind her right ear. She folds like linen. No scream. Just a breathy little oh? before her knees give way and she crumples.

But she’s not dead. Not yet. That’s going to be the fun part of the evening.

I hoist her up — arms under hers, head lolling like a doll — and limp us to the Beetle. I already cleared the front seat. The door creaks open.

She groans.

I shove her in and slam it.

Nobody hears. Nobody sees. Nobody cares.

I drive for hours. Highway. Backroad. Detour. I don’t remember the turns. My pulse is louder than the engine. Every few minutes she makes a noise — semi-conscious, like a drunk girl coming to. I reach over and slam her face into the dashboard until the noises stop. Her lip splits. Her breasts are falling out of her t-shirt, and blood trickles down her neck.

By the time we get to Taylor Mountain, she’s dead.

Or close enough.

I unload her behind the same tree. The same tree I used for the last one.

It’s quiet. The kind of quiet you only get this far out. I unzip my pants. Her blood is still damp on my hands.

I position her just right. Not out of respect. Out of… curiosity. Usually I like them to undress, to put on a show to impress me. Dance for me. Talk for me. Be quiet for me. Be still for me.

Her legs twitch.

I grin.

It’s not about rage this time. Not fully. It’s about control. It’s about proving that I can still choose.

When I’m finished, I press my lips to her cheek.

“Gracias,” I whisper.

Then I take her earrings. A keepsake. I’ll give one to Maris eventually. In a box. Wrapped like a present.

And I drive home in the dark, windows down, the smell of pine and rot in my nose. I tell myself I’m back in control. That I did this for me.

But a part of me knows —

I did it for her. And next time… I’ll need more.


SCENE: EARLY MORNING – JUNE 1974 – UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON CAMPUS / TAYLOR MOUNTAIN First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

I wake up sweating.

For a second, I don’t remember. The mattress feels foreign. The window’s open. I can hear birds — too cheerful, too loud. My shirt is still damp, crusted with blood. My pants are around my ankles. I must’ve collapsed here. No blanket. No memory of coming inside.

Then it hits me. The alley. The limp. The crack behind her ear. The smile I couldn’t control when she dropped.

Georgann.

I sit up. Fast. Too fast.

Something’s wrong.

I look at my hands — scratched, dirt caked under the nails. I check my pockets. No earrings. No notes. Did I take the Spanish paper? I meant to. A souvenir. Something to remember her laugh by.

I grab the keys and run.

---

SCENE: EARLY MORNING – GREEK ROW – UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON

I park a block away. It’s 5:42 a.m. according to the dash. Sun just starting to flirt with the sky. A few joggers, one delivery truck.

I walk the alley like a ghost. No police tape. No crowd. No noise. But I can’t remember. Was the textbook still in her hand? Did I grab her purse? Did anyone see her walk off with me?

I duck behind a dumpster, panting, watching Clark Hall from the shadows. A girl in a sweatshirt strolls past. Not her. Blonde. Ponytail. Wrong limbs.

The fear isn't about getting caught.

It's about being sloppy.

Did I leave a shoe print? A fingerprint? Did she say something too loudly when she helped me walk?

My mouth is dry. My throat itches.

There’s a squirrel. Chattering at me from the fence. I hiss at it. It bolts.

I leave.

---

SCENE: LATER – TAYLOR MOUNTAIN – NEAR THE DEPOSITION SITE

The woods envelop sound.

I park deeper in this time, hike in the last half mile. I’ve brought gloves. A hacksaw. The bag I always mean to toss but never do.

The trees feel closer than last night. More judgmental. My foot sinks in soft dirt near the tree trunk. The one I always use. The soil’s stained. Red-brown-black.

She’s still there.

She’s gone cold, of course. But not stiff. There’s something gentle about the way her limbs have slackened. No fight left in her. No confusion. Just the beautiful silence, the cyanotic hue.

I kneel beside her. Touch her hair. The blood at her scalp has dried in strands. Her eye is open, just one — like she’s winking. Her jaw is slack. I push it closed. Then open again. I put it in her mouth. I didn’t get a chance while she was alive. Didn’t want to risk her oversized teeth sinking in.

It’s better this way. I feel the release in waves. Into her.

But I didn’t finish last night. Not properly. Not the way I like to.

So I do it now.

It takes longer than it should. I picked the wrong tool again. Should’ve brought the cleaver. The saw chatters against bone like a dull violin string. It jerks in my grip. I wipe sweat from my upper lip with my wrist.

Eventually, it’s done.

I cradle the head like a prize. A melon from the garden. She’s still beautiful. A little lopsided now. Her mouth is open again, and I find myself wondering what she’d say if she could see me like this.

“Thank you,” maybe. Or “Finish what you started.”

I wrap her in the towel. Tuck her gently in the passenger seat. Buckle her in. It makes me laugh.

We drive back in silence. No music. Just the hum of the engine. No one on the road. It feels almost romantic.

And I realise, as I turn onto the freeway, that I don’t feel panic anymore.

I feel peace. She’s mine now. Properly.


SCENE: EARLY MORNING – JUNE 1974 – TED’S ROOMING HOUSE – LIZ’S POV First Person – Elizabeth (Liz) Kendall

The first thing I notice is the smell.

Not the usual mix of cigarette ash and toothpaste he swears he doesn’t use. No — this is different. Metallic. Damp. Something feral beneath the detergent.

Ted’s shoes are by the door, but the soles are caked with something brown. His blazer is crumpled on the floor, and I know it wasn’t there when I left last night. I’d hung it carefully on the hook.

He must’ve come home late. Or early.

The bed’s made — badly. That’s how I know he did it. The corner is puckered, as if he tried to smooth it without really trying. The pillow smells like sweat. Not just the kind from work or sleep, but the kind that comes from running, from panic.

I sit on the edge of the mattress and touch the crease of the pillowcase. There’s a faint blotch. Not red. Rust brown. My stomach churns.

He’s in the kitchen. I hear the clink of a spoon in coffee. No music. No radio. Just the sound of breath and liquid and ceramic.

I want to ask him where he was, but I don’t. I’ve learned better. Questions feel like accusations to Ted. And accusations make him turn cold.

Instead, I make myself useful. I straighten the stack of National Geographics by the bookshelf. Pick up a sock, half-tucked under the couch. Put it in the laundry.

He still hasn’t said good morning.

Sometimes I think he forgets I exist when he’s in these moods. Other times, I think he wishes I’d disappear.

I watch him from the hallway. He’s standing at the counter, staring at a blank envelope. Just… staring.

He hasn’t touched his coffee.

His jaw is tight. The muscles flexing. His nails are bitten down again — he was doing better for a while, keeping them neat for job interviews.

Now he’s back to chewing them like a dog on rawhide.

I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. “Ted?”

He doesn’t turn.

“You okay?”

A beat. Then he says, “Yeah.” But it’s clipped. Not real.

I want to believe it anyway.

I force a smile. “I was thinking we could go to the farmer’s market later. Molly wants peaches.”

“I’ve got plans.”

Of course he does.

I nod. Pretend that makes sense. Pretend I’m not shrinking inside my own body. I walk past him, brush his arm lightly with mine — a habit from when he used to lean into me. Now, he flinches.

I grab my keys from the bowl by the door. “I’ll be back later. Let me know if you want dinner.”

He doesn’t reply.

When I step into the hallway, I realise I’m holding my breath.

It’s not fear. Not exactly. It’s the kind of anticipation you feel right before a car crash — when you know it’s coming, but you don’t want to be the one who says it aloud.

I close the door behind me gently.

Then I walk three blocks before I let the tears come.




SCENE: EARLY JULY 1974 – MARIS’S WING IN THE CALDWELL ESTATE– EVENING First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The doorbell rings once. Not twice — he’s too proud for that. Too afraid I might think he’s desperate, even though both of us know he is. No doubt stuttering and stammering when Luis asked for the keys to his brutalised Bug.

I let him wait as the polish on my pinkie toe dries.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show theme is already playing, volume low, washing the apartment in cheerful deflection. "Who can turn the world on with her smile…" The irony makes me grin. So does Mary. She’s so cute. Something in me just wants to hold her and kiss her on her pert little nose.

I open the door just before the second ring.

Ted’s standing there, damp at the collar, sheepish in that Republican-candidate-on-a-budget sort of way. Sport coat too square, probably swiped from a department store while an attendant was distracted. Smile too straight, almost painted on to hide his nerves. His eyes do that flickering thing — relief, confusion, desire, rage. For someone so used to staring at people like a hungry dog, he sure struggles to hold my gaze.

I tilt my head and step aside. “You’re late.”

“I wasn’t sure if I should come.”

“But you did.”

He lingers by the door, eyes grazing the soft lamp glow, now that the chandeliers are off, the bottle of wine breathing on the bedside table, the folded blanket on the sofa at the foot of the canopy bed. His brain doesn’t know whether to classify this as domestic or a threat. I can almost see it whirring, trying to categorise and label.

I toss him a smile over my shoulder. “You like TV, don’t you? Normal things. Routine. It’s what stable couples do.” I like the idea of giving him a little hope. Let him believe there’s a world where a woman like me would be in a romantic relationship with someone of his stature – or lack thereof, and that my parents wouldn’t send both of us to a psych facility or guillotine at the thought.

He hesitates. I can feel him watching the sway of my hips under the silk of my robe. Ivory, barely tied. Not a hint of lace covering anything underneath.

I curl onto the couch and pat the seat next to me. “Come on, Theodore. You know that I don’t bite.”

He sits. Slowly. Apprehensive. Confused.

We watch in silence for a moment. Mary’s tossing her hat in the air, full of hope and unfulfilled promise while I hum that she might just make it after all.

Ted exhales. His shoulders drop. “I used to watch this with Liz.”

“Don’t talk about her.” I say it sweetly, not cruelly — like I’m cutting off a child mid-sentence. “If I wanted to kill my mood, I would’ve asked Mother to join us.”

His jaw tenses.

I shift closer. “You don’t have to think when you’re here.” My head rests on his shoulder. I hear his pulse tick. He smells like soap and Georgann’s shampoo. She had it in her room when I visited her. She fastidiously took care of her appearance.

While Mary is upset about being 30 and called a ‘ma’am’, I snake one leg over his. He stiffens, then softens. I let the silence cradle him. I let him believe this is comfort. That he’s safe here. Welcomed into a second home. Slowly, but surely, I move in closer, inviting myself into his lap.

And just when his hand drifts to my thigh —

“Do you know what Diane looks like now?” I lick my lower lip, mimicking his when he’s distressed.

He freezes.

I don’t look at him. I just let it hang there, like a wet dress in winter. It almost burns to suppress the smile. The zygomatic force inside my cheekbones is overwhelming.

“She cut her hair. Works for the state now. Isn’t that something? She’s one of those career women.” I muse out loud, as if he’s not here. I’m just talking to myself.

Ted says nothing. But there’s a flicker of contempt tugging at the left side corner of his lips.

“She’s still beautiful. Even after everything. Even after you dropped her like a drunk boy trying to unwrap a gift, he knows he doesn’t deserve.”

I feel his breath hitch. A slight flare in the nostrils. Good.

“She’s the only one who ever saw through you, isn’t she? You can fool Liz. You can make girls cry on phone lines. But Diane… she was always just a little smarter. She found you to be submissive. Pliable, passive. Not the kind of man a self-respecting woman could marry. No, wait, she thought she was in a lesbian relationship since there wasn’t a man at all.”

He twitches beneath me. I can feel the rage vibrating under h

“She said even your kisses were feminine. Like you were trying to prove you were a man, but always just falling short. She said you had no idea how to pleasure a woman.”

That does it. He shoves off the blanket, allows me to fall onto the sofa. Stands.

“You brought me here to humiliate me.” His pupils have swallowed the cornflower blue.

I rise slowly, allowing the robe to slip off entirely. “No, Ted. I brought you here to remind you.”

He’s shaking.

“Of what?” he spits.

“That you’re still hungry,” I whisper. “That you haven’t done enough yet. That you’re not a man unless you’re taking something.”

I take a step closer.

“Go on,” I challenge, smiling. “Take it.”

He doesn’t move.

And then, gently, I reach past him and shut off the television.

The room goes quiet.

“I have plans tomorrow, so I need to get some shut eye.” I say, honeyed again, like I’m manning the phones and he’s a loser I’m trying to convince not to slice his jugular. “But you’ll figure something out.”

I close the door before he can speak.

Because I know what comes next.

And so does he.


SCENE: EARLY JULY 1974 – SEATTLE CRISIS CENTRE / MARIS’S WING – INTERCUT MONTAGE Liz Kendall’s POV // Stephen’s POV // Maris’s POV

LIZ: The hallway lights buzz overhead — fluorescent, faintly flickering. I shift the folder against my hip, fingers tight around the cardboard edges. Another intake form. Another girl in crisis. Another plea into a headset, asking if she feels safe at home. If there’s anyone she can call.

I shouldn’t be here. Ted said they were short staffed. Ted lied. Again. But this time, I thought I’d use it to my advantage and get a true handle on things.

Ted hasn’t been home since Tuesday. Not properly. He said something about campaigning, a fundraiser, a call list. But when I opened the mail pile last night, there was a card addressed to The Caldwell Residence. Not ours. I looked them up in the phonebook, but of course they’re not listed. Not when they own hotels dotting every city in this country. Not when their daughters smile in magazines and the society pages.

I look up from the desk.

Across the floor, framed by the soundproof glass of the call bay, is her.

The Caldwell girl. The one he said was colder than the line she answers. The one he pretends to have no interest in. She’s even more incandescent in person. Silken black hair, breasts I would’ve hoped for, even at her age. She has the nose I begged my parents to fund.

She’s laughing at something one of the male volunteers said — her fingers playing with the phone cord, the receiver perched delicately between her shoulder and cheek. Her lipstick is perfect. Her blouse is silk. No one wears silk in here.

There’s something magnetic about her. Her laughter doesn’t sound real — too melodic, too trained. A performance. But she’s not looking at the boy she’s talking to.

She’s looking straight at me. One eyebrow lazily lifted.

Our eyes lock. Hers are a piercing turquoise. When I focus, I realise she’s not looking at me. She’s looking through me, evaluating me. She’s probably wondering what Ted sees in me. I wonder that myself.

I freeze. Panic. Her lips curl into a smile.

She lifts her hand in a slight, condescending wave — a twitch of the fingers, like she’s brushing me away. Then the call ends, and she vanishes behind the dividing wall.

STEPHEN Elsewhere, a boy is becoming someone else.

He studies himself in the mirror.

The laugh — try again. It’s too soft. Too unsure.

He tries the Bundy smile. Crooked. Closed-lip. Shoulders squared. Now the shoes — brown leather, shiny, tight like they were meant for someone else. They were. He bought them after Maris said she liked the way Ted dressed.

He’s growing his hair out now. Same shade. He’s practicing how to open a car door with the same flourish. He’s started eating at the Flame Tavern, alone. Parked in the same lot. Waiting.

In his drawer, a bottle of Brut cologne. He’s never worn cologne before.

Back in his closet: a new blazer. The same shade of beige Ted wore the day Maris smiled at him.

MARIS I’m not there tonight. I skipped out early. That’s what makes it worse.

I let her see me once — perfectly dressed, a smile too sweet to be kind — and her mind will fill in the rest. Every ringing phone becomes my voice. Every door creak, my heel. Every laugh behind glass, mine.

I left nothing to chance. Told Roger to flirt with me when Liz arrived. Told Lila to offer her the front desk shift so she’d be forced to watch me work the phones, watch the boys line up with calls they could’ve taken themselves.

And I made sure to wave. Just once. A delicate twitch of the hand. The kind you give to someone you’ve already dismissed.

I’m at home now. Feet up. Watching Mary ditch an antisemitic acquaintance who refuses to allow Rhoda to play tennis with them. I’m proud. There’s no place for that intolerance in this country.

But Liz doesn’t know that. She thinks I’m right behind her.


SCENE: JULY 13, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE – MILLIE’S ROOM First Person – Millicent Cordelia Caldwell’s POV

Maris’s wing glows like a second sun across the courtyard.

I can see the light from here — low, gold, flickering through the gauze curtains. Sometimes I stare long enough to convince myself I see her shadow behind them. Stretching. Dressing. Undressing. Always graceful. Always deliberate. As though she knows someone is watching.

I press my forehead to the cool windowpane. The heat’s been unbearable lately, but in here, it’s cold. Quinn says it keeps me docile. Father doesn’t say anything at all.

She gets the wing. The imported lamps. The private entrance. I get the old nursery with the pink striped wallpaper and the bookshelf that still smells like baby powder. A tiny bathroom with squeaky taps and a mirror that warps my face.

She was born three minutes before me. That’s all. Three minutes, and now she lives like a queen while I sleep under a ballerina mobile I’m too afraid to take down.

But tonight… she’s out.

I know her patterns. I know the way she flings her shoes off in the hallway when she returns, the way she clicks her tongue when the maid forgets to put the turndown chocolate on the correct side of the pillow. I know she’s out because the Bug is gone and there was no perfume trail in the corridor.

So I slip out.

Barefoot. Quiet.

Across the marble, through the back stairwell she thinks no one remembers.

The lock to her suite is old. She broke it during a tantrum and never let Father replace it. “No one would dare,” she said.

I dare.

Her suite is warm. Vanilla and something darker. The kind of scent you remember on your fingers. Silk robes hang on the back of her door, arranged by hue. Her vanity glows under a rose-gold bulb, lined with perfumes and things I don’t recognise — powders, compacts, little tools that look like they could draw blood if used wrong.

And then I see it.

A shoebox.

Tucked beneath her vanity stool. Not hidden, not out in the open. Just there. A secret that wanted to be found.

I open it.

Photos.

Polaroids. At least a dozen.

All of women. Naked. Eyes closed, mouths parted. Some smiling. Some not. None of them Maris. None of them me.

I stare at the one on top.

She’s lying in a bed I don’t recognise, limbs limp, neck bent just a little too far. Her wrist bears a mark — almost like a bite, or a cuff burn. Her lipstick’s smudged. There's something… off about her skin. Too pale. Like she’s already…

I shake the thought. I don’t understand.

I flip it over.

No note. Just a date: April 19.

I know that date. There was a story on the news. A missing girl. A redhead, I think. University student. They said she probably ran away.

I flip another. And another.

They all have dates.

Different girls. Different poses. All with the same emptiness behind the glamour.

My throat tightens.

Maybe Maris is collecting them. Maybe it’s just a game.

But then I see one — the last one in the box.

She’s posed like a statue. Naked except for a pearl necklace. Sitting on a mirrored surface. Her eyes are open. Staring right at the camera.

She looks like me.

No. She looks like Maris.

But I can’t be sure.

The lips are slightly parted. The wrists are pressed together like they’re bound behind the mirror edge. Her expression is blank. Not fearful. Just… empty.

I drop it.

The air feels wrong now. Like it’s pressing against my chest.
