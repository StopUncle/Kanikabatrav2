I shove everything back into the box. Close it. Replace it exactly where I found it. I don’t know what I saw. I don’t know what it means. But something inside me aches.

I slip out the way I came. Run barefoot down the hallway, heart pounding.

Back in my room, I climb into bed.

And for the first time in months, I dream of being her.

Even if it means dying.




SCENE: JULY 13, 1974 – TED BUNDY’S ROOM – NIGHT First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

SCENE: JULY 13, 1974 – TED BUNDY’S ROOM – NIGHT First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

There’s a package wedged into the screen door when I get home. The dread kicks in before I even touch it.

No return address. Just my name. Typed. Like a goddamn invitation. I stare at it too long — keys still in hand, engine still ticking outside, air heavy like it’s holding its breath. Every scream in this neighbourhood is silent. That’s how I know something’s coming.

I take it in. Sit on the bed. The paper tears like skin.

First: a newspaper clipping. Thick stock. Seattle Times – Lifestyle Section.

Engaged: Diane Edwards to Marry Dr. Richard Halvorsen

The bride-to-be, a UW grad and former staffer with Emergency Services, will wed this August. The groom is an ophthalmologist. East Coast trained. Rich. Handsome, probably. Clean fingernails. Future father of her children.

I stop reading.

My thumb smudges her smile. Diane’s teeth — visible now. She used to keep her smiles tight around me. The arm she’s holding looks strong. She’s wearing pearls. She never wore pearls with me. Said they were for women who'd given up. Now she wants to look like someone’s mother.

I crumble the clipping in my fist.

But there’s more.

Engaged: Heiress of the Caldwell Hotel Empire Maris Cornelia Caldwell to Marry Heir of Carlyle Confectionery, Hunter Bartholomew Carlyle

The bride-to-be, a university student and former Miss Washington...

I can’t read the rest. I physically can’t. My chest hollows out. My stomach contracts like I’ve been kicked. The room bends. My face is wet, I don’t know why. There’s a Polaroid.

At first glance, I don’t understand it.

Hunter is in bed — not mine, though it looks like it. The same spread. The same sheets. He’s shirtless, posing like a catalogue model. Maris is on top. Naked, back arched, head thrown back, Van Cleef bracelet glinting in the light. The tortoiseshell comb in her hair is the same one she wore when she whispered in my ear and let me—

I flip it over.

Not the first. Not the last. Just the best.

Her handwriting. Beautiful. Cold. Scripted like a death threat.

I’m shaking.

She let me believe I was first. That I’d uncovered something untouched. That her body’s response — the shaking, the tears — were mine to take credit for. That I’d made her.

She let me think I’d been chosen. Me.

I inhale. A slow, desperate sound. My hand clenches the edge of the bed like I’m going to fall off the world.

Then I see it. Another envelope.

Small. Manila. No label.

Inside: something dry. Rattling.

I tip it into my palm. A single human bone. Brown-edged. Clean.

Knuckle, maybe. Or elbow. Too smooth to be fresh. Too real to be fake.

No note this time. Just the echo of her. Like she doesn’t need to say it anymore. Like she’s moved past language.

And she has.

Because I know what this is. Taylor Mountain. It’s from Taylor Mountain.

Which means she’s been there. She’s seen what I buried. She might’ve taken it before I returned. She might’ve taken it while I was there.

Or she was just watching. Watching everything. Watching me.

I drop it.

My ears are ringing. I can’t breathe. My face feels foreign. I double over, forehead pressing into the meat of my palm.

I don’t scream.

I laugh.

It starts in my throat. Builds. My shoulders shake. I must look insane. I am insane. But so is she.

She’s not a woman. She’s a parasite. A virus I can’t kill.

Not yet. But I will.

Because tomorrow is Sunday. And I’ve made plans.

Two of them.


SCENE: SATURDAY NIGHT – CALDWELL ESTATE, MARIS’S WING First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

She’s curled up next to me like a housecat. One of Mother’s old silk slips clings to her shoulders — cream, vintage Dior, too big in the bust and hanging loose at the sides. She’d asked if she could try it on “for fun,” then never took it off. I said nothing. Dior doesn’t suit her. It’s like wrapping a whore in mink and hoping it’ll make her a lady, someone to be valued, not thrown into the gutter when the job is done. Carol’s not poor; she sleeps on linens like mine while allying with the hoi polloi, but the cognitive dissonance is what’s most sickening. She drives the Mercedes from her parents, parks a few hundred feet from the site of protests and joins in, forgetting her comfortable upbringing because it’s inconvenient.

“I think I love you,” she murmurs into the pillow. Her voice is soft, sticky, sickening.

I sip my water, disgust roiling in my gut. “No, you don’t.”

“I’m serious.”

“I know.” I reach for my lip balm, twist the cap, trying not to crush it in my fist. I see a flash of myself in the mirror, the wince very visible. I neutralise it. “That’s why I said don’t.”

She sits up, eyes wide. “You don’t feel anything? You’ve been having sex with me for three years.”

I almost laugh. But I don’t. That would hurt her, and I don’t want to hurt her. I want her gone. Cleanly gone. A footnote that’s hidden from history and prying eyes.

Carol’s not like the others. She wants soft things. Sleepovers. Breakfasts. Public acknowledgement. She asked me, just this morning, if I’d ever tell anyone about us. As if my reputation could survive that. As if my mother wouldn’t flay us both alive and use the blood for toner. I’d rather the flaying than the degeneracy of being with a woman. I’m a conservative. I have values that I’m not willing to throw out the door because they’re conflicting with my feelings. Carol doesn’t seem to realise lust is the feeling, not love. I could never love her.

“Carol,” I say, turning toward her with the voice I reserve for widows and waiters, “you knew what this was. You knew I was heterosexual and going to marry Hunter.”

Her face twists. “You don’t mean that.”

“You’re sweet,” I lie. “But sweet isn’t something that’s socially acceptable right now. I have to focus on my studies, my relationship with Hunter and my family. You know we’re in a tense spot right now. I can’t afford to piss Mother off anymore than I already do.

Even I’m impressed with my improvisation skills. As if Daddy would let Quinn throw me out. As if I’d go through with a marriage instead of burning his house down and then delivering the eulogy. As if I’d let anyone get in the way of my academic perfection.

Silence.

I can see it now — the flicker of rebellion forming behind her eyes. She’ll do something stupid. Tell someone. Maybe one of the campus girls. Maybe the wrong boy. Maybe my father.

I glance at the clock. 9:03 p.m. Saturday. Tomorrow, Lake Sammamish will be flooded with sunburnt college girls pretending to read Kerouac, and boys pretending not to stare. The kind of place a predator could thrive.

I look back at her. She’s crying now, quietly. “You know Maris, I’m not disposable.’ She is. Incredibly so. “You can’t just hide me like I’m some secret shame. A mistake on your transcripts. I’m a person, Maris. I’m human. I have feelings. I thought you did too.’ She’s sobbing harder now, the tears streaming instead of trickling. “Your mother could find out. The junior league could find out. I could tell them right now. I could tell Hunter right now.” A hot flash of rage consumes me. My teeth involuntarily clench. Who the fuck does she think she is? Coming to my house, wearing my mother’s clothing, threatening to ruin my life? I stifle it and soothe her. Placate her with lies of commitment. Of promises to end things with Hunter, forget political ambitions with the people who allegedly resent us.

“I need a favour,” I say, tone warm again when she’s sufficiently recovered from the hysteria. She perks up real quick — like a puppy offered a reprieve, or a homeless person being offered the cocaine they desire instead of a loaf of bread. “I need you to come with me to the lake tomorrow. Sammamish. Early. There’s a flyer being handed out for a community outreach program, some Republican fluff. I told Daddy I’d go, as I do annually. Family thing. It’ll be the perfect place to announce our relationship.” I smile. “I think it’s only fair, after everything I’ve put you through over the years, Carol. You know I do love you, despite not voicing it as I should.”

She wipes her cheek. “You want me to go… with you? Around your parents, around them?” The contempt for the GOP is clear in her voice but quickly overshadowed by optimism. This grade A moron thinks I’ll actually detonate my own life for her.

“You deserve this.” I offer a gentle smile. She cries happy tears instead.

A pause. Then she nods. “Okay, I’ll go. Thank you.”

I take her hand. “Wear that red halter. The one you wore at the marina. You looked perfect in it.”

Her face glows. It’s disgusting how little it takes.

“Carol,” I say softly, like I mean it, “you might just make someone’s whole day.”

And maybe she will.

For the last time.


JULY 14, 1974 – LAKE SAMMAMISH STATE PARK First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

There are bodies everywhere. Not corpses — not yet — but bodies. Bare shoulders glistening with oil, knees pressed into beach towels, sand and grass, elbows bent behind necks. Laughter, somewhere, bouncing like a beach ball off a beer cooler. Children squeal near the shallows. A dog barks and snaps at its leash. And somewhere in the mess, the one in red.

She’s like a siren cutting through the pastel blur. That halter is so red it’s practically bleeding. No bra — I can tell. Her tits move independent of her body, real and soft, like dough you could rip with your teeth. Lean legs, thin enough to break without much force. She’s scanning the crowd like she’s waiting for someone. A friend. A parent. Maybe even a lover. She’s a pretty thing. Blonde, green eyes. Gap between her front two teeth.

I step further into the grass, sunglasses low on my nose. The sun is nauseating. Everything is too bright. I slept like shit. Woke up with the Polaroid stuck to my cheek and the bone still on the desk. I should’ve thrown it out. Burned it. Swallowed it. I should’ve driven to Maris’s estate and beat her to death with my bare hands, hacked her head off to shut her up. But instead, I showered. Shaved. Cleaned my nails. And got dressed like I was going to church. I asked Liz where she was going. Her eyes lit up like I’d be there to meet her. I just needed to know she was out of the way, but her delusions and optimism helped ensure she’d stay where she was.

The Bug is parked out of sight. This time I made sure. There’s no way I’m leaving fingerprints. No scraps of receipts. No paper trail. I don’t care how good she is — she won’t know where this one ends up.

I fix my arm sling. Left side, slightly askew. Just enough to sell the injury. Women love a man in need. Especially ones who smile politely. Ones who don’t look like they’d snap your neck or hang around at bars.

I approach. Slowly. She doesn’t see me yet. She’s crouched near the concession stand, talking to some kid with a clipboard. She’s smiling — not widely, but it’s real. And it’s not for me. It will be. I wait until she’s alone.

Then I cross.

“Excuse me,” I say, voice warm, apologetic. “Hi. I don’t mean to be a bother, but — would you mind helping me get my sailboat down off the trailer?” She turns. Eyes me. Then her face softens. “You’re not a bother. You need help?”

“Just for a second. I hate to ask a stranger, but you looked like you could probably handle it better than any of the guys here.” She laughs. That’s the trick. Flatter. Never creep.

She glances around, then back at me. “Sure. Where’s your car?” I gesture to the trees. “Just past the lot. Only takes a minute.” She hesitates. It’s brief. But it’s there. “I’m meeting someone.” “They’ll wait. Or you’ll be back before they notice.” I smile. I tilt my head. I keep my tone just humble enough. She sighs. “Okay. One sec.”

We walk. I keep the pace slow. Let her follow. She’s talking — something about school, a friend named Maris, how they’ve known each other for years. I nod. I say nothing. The name slices through me like a hot blade, but I don’t flinch. I just smile. She tells me she’s nervous. “It’s weird, isn’t it?” she says. “All the girls going missing. My roommate said not to come out here.” There’s that famous female laugh. It echoes in my head. “Do I look dangerous?” She grins. “Not particularly.” That’s the last full sentence she’ll say.

By the time we reach the trees, the path is quiet. I guide her around the bend — toward the Bug. She’s still talking. I reach into the car — pretend I’m reaching for rope. Then I hit her.

Hard. Once. Twice. She drops like a sack of laundry. A small gasp escapes her throat, but that’s all. She’s light. Easy to lift. The trunk creaks. Swallows her whole.

I slam it shut. The forest hums around me. The sun still blazes like nothing’s happened.

And I smile.

Because I’m not done. Not today.

SCENE: JULY 14, 1974 – LAKE SAMMAMISH STATE PARK – MIDDAY First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The Bug is still warm. The first one has been deposited into the forest. Silenced. Maybe unconscious. Maybe dead. Maybe listening. Doesn’t matter. She’s there and I’m flying. And I’m not finished.

The high hasn’t peaked yet. My heart is sprinting, but I can still see. Think. Smile. That’s how I know there’s more in me. One isn’t enough. Not today. I’ll show that cunt what a real man can do. I check my watch. Just past noon. Still plenty of time. Still plenty of bodies waiting to be surveyed.

The lake glistens like glass when I reemerge from the trees. My shirt is tucked again. My hair is combed back with fingers. The arm sling is still on — God bless the performance. I’m everyone’s son-in-law. Everyone’s maybe. I scan the crowd. Look for solitude. For someone bored. For someone waiting. For someone who thinks an injury takes away a man’s capacity for possession.

And then I find her. Sitting cross-legged on the grass, halfway through a sandwich. She’s brunette, freckled, with a paperback folded open across her knee. She glances up every few seconds, scanning for someone who isn’t coming. She’s perfect. Not as flashy as the red halter, but that’s the point. She won’t be remembered. She’s nothing.

I walk up slow. Practiced smile. The clumsy approach. “Excuse me, uh, — I don’t mean to interrupt—” She looks up. Blinks once. “Yeah?” “I need a bit of help. My sailboat—” I gesture vaguely toward the woods. “I was trying to load it onto my car and my brother bailed on me. I hate to ask a stranger, but—” She closes the book. “Where is it?” “Just down the path. Won’t take more than a second.” “Alright.” She brushes crumbs from her lap. “Let me finish my sandwich.”

She’s polite. That’s the key. These girls don’t want to be rude. Don’t want to embarrass a man. Even if he’s a stranger. Even if the air feels wrong. Even if the hairs on her arm rise like static. She’s a perpetual puppet, like the rest. Men like me handle the strings.

She rises. I thank her. She smiles. We walk.

Her name’s not important. She offers it, but I don’t register it. I give her mine: Ted. No fake names today. Too many people know me; I’m not screwing it up for something that’ll be wiped off the planet in an hour. I’m real now. My hands feel like they’re buzzing.

Halfway down the path, she starts talking. “You’re lucky I was sitting alone. Most girls would’ve told you to ask a ranger.” “Then I’m glad it was you.” It’s forced. The words grate. If I were younger, I’d roll my eyes. She smiles again. A little proud of herself. Delusional. She doesn’t ask about the other girl. Doesn’t know I’ve already claimed one. Doesn’t feel the storm building behind her. The terrified, guttural yelps of another animal fighting for its life, the delicious death roars, the pleading, the crying.

The parking lot is deserted by the trees. I gesture to the Bug. “Right there. It’s just the rigging. I can’t lift it with one arm.” She leans in to see. And I hit her.

She screams — just once — but it’s enough to make my ears ring. I hit her again. Then again. Until she stops moving, until it becomes a blur. This one’s heavier. Awkward. She slides in, but not cleanly. I jam the lid down, slam it once, twice, until it catches. There’s blood on the backseat. Shit.

I glance around. No one’s watching. But I know this is sloppy. I can almost hear her criticising me. I thought it might’ve been a bit ambitious to try two, maybe I should’ve kept it at one, save an attempt for another at another location, a different day. But I felt too good not to. The opportunity was there; I just needed to seize it.

I get in the driver’s seat. Turn the key. The Bug coughs, then roars to life. I glance in the rearview mirror. She’s out cold. The stillness is what excites me. They’ll both be there. Together. Watching each other scream, claw, beg. A matched set. One hoping the other kicks the bucket first.

I exhale. Hands still trembling. Maris was right. I am hungry.

But now I’m also something else. Exposed.

She’ll smell the blood from miles away. But finally, I don’t care. I’m practically excited for her response.

SCENE: JULY 14, 1974 – CASCADE MOUNTAIN RANGE – LATE AFTERNOON First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The road hums under the tires like a lullaby made of rot. I know every turn. Every dip. Every patch of gravel that jostles the steering wheel. This isn’t new. I’ve got the Mary Tyler Moore Show’s opening tune stuck in my head. Nixon’s voice warbles from the radio, followed by a commentator claiming the country will be plunged into poverty with the current gas prices. I can’t help but laugh. I pay with women’s chequebooks, or the cash left in their bags. Sometimes I’ll leave the Bug with minimal fuel while I visit Liz. She always fills it up.

The cargo is slumped in the back. One of them groaned once, half an hour ago. I don’t know which. I didn’t check. I didn’t stop. I kept driving.

The trees thicken the higher I climb. Pine needles dust the shoulders like confetti from a celebration no one survived. Birds scream overhead. I park in a clearing just shy of the logging road. No one comes here but me.

The heat is slick. The sun is low and hostile. I open the trunk.

Carol’s shirt is torn. Her bra strap snapped. There’s a trickle of blood behind her ear, and something in her mouth — maybe teeth, maybe not. Her body is pliable, dead weight. She’s gone. Something had started already — ants, maybe, or something with teeth. She won’t be pretty much longer.

The second girl is slouched at an angle; arms crossed over her chest like a poorly posed mannequin. Her eyes are open. One is clouded. The other looks like it wants to accuse me, like it’s trying to remember the shape of my face for the detectives. All I remember is the way I untied her from the tree, so she felt like she had the chance to survive, to outrun me. Women are very delusional in that aspect. They’ll never accept their inferiority. The shrieks proved that definitively. I could look at the still, battered faces all day.

I slam the trunk shut.

Work first.

I drag the blonde into the trees. Her skin’s already cooling. I roll her onto her side near a cluster of ferns. I tear off her clothes. I don’t bother with ceremony. I want this done.

The second takes longer. She’s heavier, less cooperative. Somewhere in the distance, a branch cracks. I freeze. Wait. Listen. Nothing.

I dump her by the ridge, not far from the others. She won't be found for a while. Not until the frost lifts. Not until she’s bone, her flesh ravaged by animals.

Back at the Bug, I clean what I can with an old towel and Pine-Sol. The blood’s smeared into the fabric. I’ll need to strip it later. Burn it maybe. Liz notices everything, and now she’s not the only one watching.

When I’m satisfied, I shut the trunk. Adjust my collar. My knuckles are sore.

I drive down the mountain in silence, like a man returning from a long day’s work. Like nothing’s changed. I’m tired, I won’t lie, almost like I’m off the tail-end of a bout of the flu. Nobody could understand how difficult it is to pull something like this off.

---

SCENE: JULY 14, 1974 – LIZ’S APARTMENT – EVENING Third Person Limited – Liz Kloepfer’s POV

The knock comes at dusk, hours after he said he’d be there.

She’s halfway through folding laundry when she hears it. Her daughter’s asleep in the other room. The house smells like fabric softener; she’s done his laundry for him. Two batches. It’s cosy inside, a reprieve from the mosquitos and the children’s excited squeaks at the park. Ted had asked where she’d be. When she said she felt like going to Lake Sammamish, he’d told her to avoid it for the crowds, implying he’d prefer the more intimate setting nearby. She was looking expectantly, hoping to see those bright eyes and the knowing smile, there to surprise her and Molly. This hope had been dashed, and she packed her picnic blanket, basket (sandwiches for Ted still uneaten) and Molly into her car before driving home.

When she opens the door, he’s there. Ted. Shirt unbuttoned at the throat. Hair mussed. Smiling like nothing’s wrong. But he looks tired, worn out. No colour in the face, a runny nose, none of his excitement.

“Hey,” he says. “Want to get a burger?”

She doesn’t ask where he’s been. She’s learned not to.

They drive in silence. He eats two hamburgers, finishes her fries. He’s hungrier than she’s ever seen him.

When they return, he stretches out on her rug and falls asleep. No kisses. No flirting. Just flat on his back, arms at his sides, like he’d worked a double shift without a single break.

Liz doesn’t know it yet, but her rug now holds the scent of two dead girls.

She watches him snore softly, and thinks — for a moment — he looks like a boy. Just a boy.


SCENE: JULY 15, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, MILLIE’S BEDROOM

First Person – Millicent Caldwell’s POV

The air in my room tastes like dust and lavender. Not the fresh kind — not the French kind Maris keeps in silk sachets tied to her lingerie drawers — but the chemical kind. The kind that comes from cheap spray bottles, disguised as class.

My curtains are drawn, though the sun is clawing at the fabric. A single strip of light cuts across the carpet like a theatre spotlight. If I move just right, it lands across my stomach. I don’t move.

There’s a breakfast tray on the floor near the door. No one knocked. They just left it there. I can see the edges of toast curling up like dead leaves. The butter’s congealed. The jam’s sweating in its silver cup.

Maris’s wing is three doors down. She gets a wing. I get a bedroom. Her walls are upholstered. Mine are wallpapered. She has a closet that walks back further than some motel rooms. I have a dresser with a squeaky top drawer.

I’m not stupid. I know I’m not. They think I am — my parents, Hunter, Maris most of all. She always used to call me a pudding. Something sweet and soft and too easy to swallow. She was three minutes older. She used to tell me that made her wiser. That God sent her first because I wasn’t done cooking.

I touch the inside of my wrist. The skin’s smooth again. I’ve been good. No new lines. But I’ve been thinking. Not just about her. About him.

Ted.

I looked him up. I know his name now — all of it. Theodore Robert Bundy. I even called the crisis centre once. Didn’t say anything. Just listened. Hung up when someone said hello. I think I wanted to hear his voice.

I’ve been watching Maris more closely than usual. She disappears some nights. Comes home flushed. Smiling. She keeps locking her door now. I heard her humming once. She doesn’t hum. Not unless she’s done something particularly cruel and gotten away with it.

I wonder if she knows what it feels like to be left out of your own life. To hear your name only when someone else is in trouble. To be called a liability. A mistake.

I used to dream we’d run away. That she’d grow bored of the games and we’d leave together. That she’d apologise. That she’d hug me properly, not that stiff, half-smile she does for family photos. That she’d say it wasn’t my fault for being born second.

But that was before the party. Before Hunter. Before I bled on the inside and no one cared.

Now I just sit. And wait. And wonder what it would feel like to be special.

The television’s on low in the sitting room down the hall. I can hear the news anchor’s voice rising like static. Something about a missing girl. Lake Sammamish. A red halter top.

Carol.

I shuffle to the door. Open it just a crack. The corridor is lit like a gallery. Quinn’s heels are tapping across the marble. I don’t step out. I just press my fingers against the edge of the doorframe and hold.

Because I know what’s coming. I know she’ll be in the drawing room. I know they’ll be talking about it. And I know — I just know — that Maris will be smiling.

Like she always does. Like the world is a deck of cards, and she’s already stolen all the queens.

I shut the door.

And I smile too.

Just to see what it feels like.


SCENE CONTINUED: JULY 15, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, MILLIE’S BEDROOM

First Person – Millicent Caldwell’s POV

I count to ten. Then twenty. Then thirty.

I walk to my closet and slide the door open, slow and silent. It’s mostly dresses. Floral ones Quinn insists make me look “wholesome.” I hate them. There’s a green turtleneck too tight in the chest. A pair of shoes I once wore to church, still scuffed at the toe.

But I’m not looking for those.

I reach to the back, behind the coats. There’s a small wooden box I kept from when we were nine — originally full of costume jewellery, the kind that turned your skin green. I open it. The necklace I stole from Maris is still inside. A single freshwater pearl on a chain. She never noticed it missing. Or she did, and didn’t care enough to ask.

I take it out. Put it on. It sits wrong against my skin. Foreign. Slightly too tight. But it feels like something.

The hallway is quiet now. I step out. The sound of the television is clearer from the drawing room.

“…Carol Greene, a student at the University of Washington and daughter of local attorneys Jeffrey and Linda Greene, was last seen wearing a red halter top…”

I move toward it. Carefully. The corridor floor is cold against my soles. I forgot shoes. I peek just before I enter — just enough to see Hunter lounging, Quinn stiff-backed, and Maris in her place like always, centre of the painting.

And she’s smiling.

I don’t go in. I back away. My chest feels tight.

I walk to the telephone at the far end of the hall. The one no one uses anymore. The one Mother keeps for show. I lift the receiver.

I dial the crisis centre.

I know the number by heart.

When the operator answers, I clear my throat. “Hi… um… is Ted there?” A pause.

Then, “Ted’s not on shift tonight.” “Oh.” I force a smile into my voice. “That’s alright. Just… just tell him Millie called.” “Millie…?” “Millicent Caldwell.” I hang up before she can ask anything else.

Then I walk slowly back to the shadows. Back to my room. Back to the place where I’m never seen.

But this time, I leave the door open.




SCENE: JULY 15, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, DRAWING ROOM First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

There’s a half-eaten croissant on the Baccarat saucer. I wasn’t hungry before. Now I’m ravenous. Quinn watches me as I demolish it in three bites, her eyes telling me how disappointed she is that I’m consuming food. We can’t all live in alcohol and barbiturates, but that’s not something she chooses to believe.

The morning news drones from the television in the far corner of the room, propped delicately atop the ormolu stand Mother loathes but Daddy insists is "modern." The air smells like citrus polish and freshly brewed coffee.

Hunter is beside me, leg slung casually over the edge of the armchair. One of his loafers is half-off. He’s polishing an apple against his shirt like a caricature. I often wonder if he ever looks in the mirror and sees himself truly; if it were me, I’d top myself. Millie’s curled up at the window, arms around her knees, trying to seem small. And failing. I wince at the sight of her cheeks. Full like a chipmunk. Red like the backend of a baboon. I’ll have to tell Mother to stop allowing the jam in; it’s going to more than just Millie’s thighs.

The maids float through — not the trained and perfectly obedient ones whose visas can be revoked, just filler girls. Some even have local accents. Quinn's been "elevating the underprivileged" again for PR.

One of them—Marleen, maybe—gasps.

The TV cuts to a new anchor.

"…a young woman, believed to be twenty years old, was reported missing late yesterday afternoon from Lake Sammamish State Park. Carol Greene, a student at

the University of Washington and daughter of local attorneys Jeffrey and Linda Greene, was last seen wearing a red halter top…"

There’s a photo.

Taken at a marina last summer, when I took her out for ice cream and ate her out under the boardwalk until she cried. She’s grinning, red lipstick, that gap in her teeth. The halter’s the one I picked.

Hunter’s brow furrows. “Didn’t we know her?”

“Carol Greene?” Millie says. “Oh my God. You used to be close, didn’t you?”

Everyone’s watching me.

I take a slow sip of tea. Let it burn my tongue before I speak. Then—without meaning to—I smile. I don’t know what’s happening. It’s as if I’ve lost control of the motor function necessary to stifle it.

It’s just a small smile. Not enough to count as unkind. But far, far too much to be considered sane. I’m struggling to wipe it off.

Millie’s mouth parts. Hunter freezes. One of the maids drops a tray.

“Maris,” he says lowly. “You’re smiling.”

I blink. Adjust my posture. Touch my lips like something’s caught there. “Am I?” I clear my throat. “It’s just—” I fake a breathy laugh. “She always wanted attention. This is, her, uh, probably being rebellious again. She mentioned she was going to hitchhike down to Santa Rosa, so maybe she followed through on her plans.”

No one laughs with me.

The room feels like a painting that’s just cracked down the middle.

Then:

“—and in a shocking development, park officials have confirmed the remains of a second young woman were found earlier this morning, half-buried near the forested area off East Lake Sammamish Parkway. The second victim remains unidentified at this time—”

Second?

Second.

I stop smiling.

My grip on the porcelain tightens. A hairline fracture slithers across the cup. I bite the inside of my cheek so hard I taste blood.

He was only meant to take one. Carol was the sacrifice. The offering. The meal I was kind enough to bestow upon him, since his victim selection was questionable at best. And he went off-script. He took another. He wasn’t allowed to do that.

The audacity. The insanity of it. My stomach is churning, my skin vibrating with rage.

The sheer, slavering idiocy of trying to outpace me. To rub this outrageous act in my face.

Millie’s saying something — too soft to register. Hunter’s watching me now, really watching me. Like he doesn’t recognise who’s sitting across from him. Like he hasn’t seen this face in his 20 years of life on this planet.

I stand. Smooth my skirt. I walk out without a word.

There will be three. They won’t find them for months. Maybe years. But they’ll know they mattered. And Bundy will know he was never good enough. Not as clever as he thought. Not as charming. Not as cunning.

It’s time he learns where his place is in this society.


SCENE: JULY 16, 1974 — SUICIDE CRISIS CENTRE, SEATTLE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

Stephen’s loitering again. Not watching. That phase is over. He doesn’t dare. Now he lingers — near the phone booths, near the breakroom, always within hearing range, like a dog trained off-leash.

I don’t acknowledge him at first. Let him hover with his clipboard and his nervous silence. I want to see how long he lasts without praise. Answer: eleven minutes. He cracks.

“You, uh—handled that call really well. Earlier.” I don’t look up. “Which one?” “The girl from Queen Anne. Her boyfriend left. She wanted to swallow a bottle of—” “People say that every day. It’s rarely about dying. It’s about the performance of grief.” He falls silent.

I set the receiver down gently, fingers grazing the dial like it might shatter. “Do you know why she called me instead of jumping?” I ask. He shakes his head. “Because I sound like someone who matters.” I finally meet his eyes. “They don’t want help. They want hierarchy. Structure. A woman who sounds like she wouldn’t flinch if they died. So they listen.”

He looks half-horrified, half-enlightened. That’s the sweet spot. The exact moment they realise they’re not in the presence of kindness — but something far rarer. Competence.

Stephen glances around. The corridor is empty. No Ted tonight, thank Christ. I tilt my head. “Are you here to ask for more help?” He nods. “If you have time. I—I wrote out what you said I should. For the voice. The inflection. I practised.” “You practised sounding calm on a suicide hotline?” “Yes.” “Good boy.”

He flinches, but his lips twitch like he might smile. He’s learning not to mind the condescension. “I, uh… also brought the hair dye. Like you suggested. Chestnut brown.” “Perfect.” “I thought maybe it was stupid, but—” “It is,” I cut in smoothly. “But that’s never stopped anyone before.”

He lets out a shaky breath. There’s a patch of sweat on his collar already. He wears his shirts too buttoned, his belt too tight, his conscience too high. I don’t need to break him. I only need to redirect him.

He still smells faintly like bleach from the greenhouse. He shouldn’t, not after this long. Clearly the boy has no understanding of a washing machine. Or maybe my instincts are too finely honed.

“Do you regret it?” I ask suddenly. He stiffens. “What?” “The boy. The one you helped me bury.” His Adam’s apple bobs hard. “No.” I watch him closely. “Because he deserved it,” Stephen says quietly. “He tried to hurt you.”

I blink. The lie blooms so naturally from his mouth I almost smile. He’s protecting the idea of me now — not just obeying me.

“Good,” I murmur. “Then we’ll get along just fine.”


SCENE: JULY 17, 1974 – SUICIDE CRISIS CENTRE, SEATTLE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

Stephen brings me lunch again. No pretense this time. No awkward fumble of two bags and a muttered “they were out of turkey.” Just a smooth offering of ham and Swiss on rye, tightly wrapped, the crusts cut off. I didn’t ask for that. Which is why it pleases me.

“Diet Coke, no ice,” he says. “I remembered.” “Congratulations. You’re capable of absorbing instruction.” He laughs like I made a joke.

We sit in the back corridor. I don’t thank him. I never do. I let the silence hang between us like a blade. It keeps him sharpened.

He tries to fill it. “I was reading that book you mentioned — the one by Carl Rogers? Client-centred therapy?” “Skimming is not reading.” “I highlighted things.” “Did you understand them?” He swallows. “I think so. The part about unconditional positive regard—” I hold up a finger. “Stop.” He freezes. “That part,” I say, “is for the callers. Not for you.”

His mouth opens, then shuts again. Good.

I unwrap the sandwich. It’s not as repulsive as yesterday’s. Maybe because he cut it diagonally. Maybe because I’ve conditioned him to earn my consumption.

“You look different today,” I murmur between bites. He perks up. “I used the dye.” “I noticed.” He waits for more. Praise. Validation. A pat on the head. I finish the sandwich instead.

“You should cut your hair shorter,” I say eventually. “And speak slower. Your voice trembles when you’re nervous. It makes people think you’re unsure of what you’re saying.” He nods too fast. “Okay. I can do that.” “You should also sit differently. You hunch.” He straightens immediately. “Better. The posture of a man who matters.”

He beams like a child told he’s clever. Ted walks past the end of the hallway just in time to see it.

Our eyes meet. His jaw tics. Stephen doesn’t notice. He’s too busy absorbing every syllable like scripture.

“You’re building something,” I tell him softly. “Don’t waste time apologising for it.” “I won’t.” “Good. Because boys like you don’t get many chances. And this is your moment to become someone people don’t forget.”

A beat. Then, softly— “Like you?”

I lean in, lips near his ear. “No, Stephen. Not like me.” I rise without another word. Leave him sitting in the fluorescent hush, spine straight, heart racing, hair darkened, face lit like salvation just brushed past him.

I don’t look back. But I know. He’s watching me again.















SCENE: THE ANNOTATED COMPARISON — JULY 18, 1974 First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The envelope’s unmarked again. Cream paper, the kind that now makes me flinch. No return address. No smudge of a thumb. Just my name — “Ted Cowell” — in that same thin, precise hand. I take it into the bathroom, away from prying eyes.

I know I shouldn’t open it. I shouldn’t let her have any power. I do anyway.

Inside are two Polaroids. Glossy. Square. One is of Liz — snapped from behind, bent slightly over the bathtub, her daughter splashing in the water. Her hair’s pulled back. Her bra strap is showing. There’s a ring of sweat at her back. The cellulite on her thighs is caught just wrong in the flash. All I see is sag and cottage cheese.

She looks like a mother. Like a woman who’s lived in a body. Who’s birthed another.

The second one hits like a knife.

Maris.

Naked but posed, casually. One leg tucked under her, a hand at her throat. Nipples hard, lips parted, a quiet look on her face like she doesn’t know she’s being watched — but of course she does. Her skin is smooth, lithe, unbroken. She looks unreal. Like a statue you’d defile.

On the back of each photograph is handwriting. Red ink. Underlined.

LIZ. – 30+ – sagging breasts – veins behind knees – signs of childbirth – overplucked brows – emotionally needy – keeps groceries in paper bags with her name written in felt tip – always waiting

MARIS. – 18 – high, symmetrical breasts – no signs of use – old money, high IQ – knows your real name – doesn’t need you. – but fuck, you want her

And then at the bottom: “Compare & contrast. Which one are you actually inside?”

I crush the envelope in my fist, my jaw seizing, I chew on my lip as the rage bubbles. I want to scream. I want to tear the bathroom apart. Rip the faucet out of the wall. Smash the tiles.

I want to find her. Grab her by the throat and force her to feel what she’s done. Force her to understand the weight of this humiliation.

Liz is in the kitchen, humming, making dinner. Her daughter’s watching TV, wrapped in a towel. They don’t know that death is sitting on their sofa with the TV Guide in his lap, stewing in the afterglow of a double homicide and a triple insult.

Maris strikes again, But I’m not done. She’s made her move. And I’m going to make mine. Money can’t protect her from everything. Not when she has her own secrets to hide.

---

SCENE: INTERLUDE — JULY 18, 1974 Third Person – Molly’s POV

Molly’s legs swing back and forth from the couch. Her towel’s still damp, her hair curled into a tangle. Sesame Street plays in bursts — the volume flickers when the antenna shifts, but she doesn’t mind. She watches Big Bird talk about friendship while her mom stirs spaghetti in the kitchen.

She can hear her mom humming, but it’s a sad kind of hum. The kind where the notes get swallowed sometimes, like she’s thinking too hard. Molly hugs the teddy bear tighter.

Then the bathroom door shuts. Loud. Fast. And Ted doesn’t say hi.

He always says hi.

She looks at the hallway, then at her mom. Her mom isn’t humming anymore.

---

SCENE: JULY 1974 – TED’S APARTMENT – EARLY EVENING First Person – Liz Kloepfer’s POV

The envelope is a thick ivory, wedged between the Childcraft books and the phone bill. No return address. No stamp. Just his name — Ted — scrawled in red pen, underlined. I stare at it for a moment, feeling my stomach pull tight, the way it does when Molly has a fever that won’t break.

Ted brought the mail in, I think. Or maybe I did. I can’t remember. He’s in the shower, humming something tuneless, off-key. I hear the water hitting tile, the occasional squeak of movement. That sound should calm me. It doesn’t.

I open the envelope.

There’s no note. No explanation. Just a photograph.

At first, I don’t understand what I’m looking at.

It’s a side-by-side — two Polaroids taped to a sheet of white paper. One is of me. Nud

curl my leg when I’m cold. He must’ve taken it without me knowing. Or maybe I forgot. I’ve learned to forget a lot of things with Ted.

The second photo is her. Maris.

I’ve only seen her once, maybe twice. At the crisis centre, weeks ago. She’s younger than me. Maybe eighteen, maybe nineteen. She has the kind of body men never look away from — skin like porcelain, legs women cry for. I remember feeling invisible the second she walked in.

Underneath both photos, there are annotations in handwriting I don’t recognise. Not his, not mine. Maybe hers.

• Loose skin here → an arrow points to my stomach. • Stretch marks (note texture) • Sag here — likely from breastfeeding • Compare hip symmetry — left side collapsed • Mole? Or age spot?

Her side is pristine. Unmarked. Angelic, someone’s written.

There’s a final line under mine: “Used. Like a second-hand car.”

The room tilts. I hear the shower stop.

I don’t move. I can’t. My hands are shaking so badly the envelope flutters to the floor. I want to scream. Instead, I fold the paper back over the photos and slide it into the drawer beneath the phone book.

I sit. I stare at the floor. I wait.

When he emerges — damp hair, towel slung low on his hips, fresh as if nothing is rotting between us — I smile despite the raw panic in my chest.

“Ted,” I say softly, “can we talk?”

He looks up. Startled, maybe. Or calculating. There’s something in his eyes — a flicker. He knows. And for the first time in our entire relationship, I don’t look away.

---

SCENE CONTINUATION: JULY 1974 – TED’S APARTMENT – EVENING First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

She’s sitting on the edge of the couch. Perfect posture. Hands folded like she’s trying to keep them from shaking. And she’s smiling — that tight, too-nice smile women wear when they’ve seen something they weren’t supposed to.

I know that smile. I fucking hate it. I’ve watched it crack off a dozen faces right before the scream.

“Can we talk?” she says.

I play dumb. “Sure. What’s up?”

I grab a shirt off the armrest, slide it over my head. I keep my voice light, just a guy finishing a shower, about to kiss his girlfriend and ask what’s for dinner.

She doesn’t say anything. She gestures to the drawer. The one by the phone.

“I found the envelope.”

My throat goes dry. I keep my eyes on her face. Not too still. Not too reactive. Play the man. Play the part. Boyfriend. Stepfather.

“What envelope?”

She opens the drawer. Holds up the photos.

Fuck. My throat constricts like Maris’s cold hand is around it.

“I don’t know what that is,” I say. My voice sounds distant — airy, like I’m listening to myself speak from underwater.

“It’s your room.”

“It’s not.”

“That’s your lamp, Ted.”

“Plenty of people have lamps.”

“Is that me?”

“I don’t know, Liz. Is it?”

She flinches. Just a little. I press in. I’ve been able to fool this woman into thinking I’m monogamous. That I care about her.

“You think I took naked pictures of you and showed them to some—some sick person who made… annotations?”

I laugh. A hollow sound. “Jesus, Liz. Do you hear yourself?”

She doesn’t look away. I feel the sweat on my temples. I wish she’d shut the fuck up for once.

“Who is she?” she asks.

“Nobody.”

“You had someone compare us.”

“No—”

“You wanted me to feel old. To feel used.”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

I reach for her. She recoils.

And that’s when it happens. Something inside me breaks.

The calm slips off like a bad disguise, and I’m on my feet, towering over her now, my voice cracking open like an axe splitting wood. If lying won’t work, intimidation will. There’s always a way to break a woman.

“You think you’re some prize?” I hiss. “You think men line up for a single mother with stretch marks and fucking insecurities? You’re lucky I’m here. You’re lucky.”

She goes pale. Good. She should.

“I could’ve had anyone. I could have women you dream of being. You think I need to take pictures of you? You think I’d show you to anyone?”

I step closer. My hands curl. I want to strangle the doubt out of her. I want to press the truth into her neck until she forgets everything she just saw.

Instead, I pull back. I exhale hard. Step away. Pantomime exhaustion.

“Liz,” I say. “I’m sorry. I’m just… tired. Stressed. Applying for law school… the hotline… it’s a lot.”

I sit down across from her. Lower my eyes. Shake my head like a man ashamed of himself. I’ve had a lot of practice.

“You know I love you, right?”

She doesn’t answer.

“I don’t know who sent that. But I swear to you, I didn’t.”

A pause.

“Some girl at the centre, maybe. They get obsessed. They think I’m theirs. I have no control over that.”

She still doesn’t speak.

“I would never hurt you.”

The lie tastes like copper. I wait. Let the silence sit. But I know. She saw it. And she won’t forget. Women never do.

---

SCENE: LATER THAT NIGHT – TED’S BEDROOM First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

She’s asleep beside me. Or pretending to be. I lie flat, eyes open.

The rage is humming beneath my ribs. Buzzing through my spine.

Why couldn’t she just laugh it off? Why did she have to ask questions? I didn’t mean for her to see it. Maris got lucky, or maybe she’s smarter than I am.

That’s the part that festers. That Maris played me. That she got in my head.

That she made me hurt Liz. And I liked it.

No one’s ever made me feel like this. Not Diane. Not anyone. Maris isn’t just playing games. She’s rewriting the rules.

I clench the sheet between my fists. She’s going to regret it. She’s going to beg me to stop.

And I’m not going to.

Not next time.

SCENE CONTINUATION: JULY 1974 – OUTSIDE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The car smells like stale gum and ethnic sweat. Jose’s Corolla — one of the newer ones, but still cheap. The kind of car that pities itself at traffic lights. I made him park two blocks down and take the bus back to the estate. A twenty for his trouble and a warning not to speak of it again, unless he wants to be deported. I’m chowing down on fries, four at a time. Almost swallowing the cheeseburger whole. I’m ravenous. I prefer McDonald’s to popcorn when I’m about to watch a show.

The windows are cracked. Cigarette smoke curls toward the roof like incense at a funeral. I’m wearing Millie’s old cardigan, one of the shapeless yellow ones she clung to for modesty during her first year of puberty. I look like any other girl. A jilted girlfriend. A secretary waiting on her shift. Nothing threatening.

Except Ted would probably know I am.

The lights are on in Liz’s apartment. I see her silhouette first — pacing — arms folded. The envelope is in her hands.

Good girl. Take it, Lizzie.

It takes him longer to arrive. He’s always late when he’s spiralling. I see his profile before the headlights cut. That straight nose. That too-eager smile. His gait. Like a frat boy trying to look honourable. He’s holding it together.

For now.

I light another cigarette. Blow the smoke directly into the night. Lick the salt off my pinkie. The milkshake tastes especially indulgent tonight.

Through the glass, it starts. I feel alive.

Liz holds it up. The photo. The comparison.

My handwriting’s on the back. Little red circles. Arrows. Notes. All the ways she fails to match me.

Stomach soft. Hips too wide. Stretch marks. "Used." "32." "Secondhand."

He’s trying to talk her down. I can tell from the way his shoulders lift, then drop. He always does that when he lies — breathes big. He’ll use charm first. The boyish shrug. The poor misunderstood genius act.

Then he’ll pivot.

And there it is — the snap. The rage. Getting in her face like he tried to get in mine.

He stands too fast. She flinches. Her hand covers her mouth. He’s yelling now — you can tell by the veins in his neck, the stiff arms, the pacing. He’s coming undone in real time.

I smile.

He thinks this is the worst of it.

He has no idea.

There’s a small part of me — a twitch in my spine — that wonders if he’ll hit her. I don’t particularly care, but I’m curious. He’s been circling it for weeks. He doesn’t handle rejection well. Especially not from someone who’s supposed to be his furniture.

But he doesn't hit her. He retreats. Pathetic. Cowardly. Henry would’ve belted her across the face. It’s not like there’s any beauty to protect.

There’s the final play — the sad, soft voice. The “baby, I’m tired.” The “you know I love you.”

I watch Liz look at him like she doesn’t quite believe he’s human.

Good girl, Lizzie, hold him accountable.

The light flickers. He’s shrinking again, folding himself small on her couch like a boy who had a bad dream and can’t seem to shake it.

He looks ridiculous from here.

And she’s still holding the photo.

Perfect.

I tap the ash out the window and grin.

He’s going to try to kill me soon.

Let him.

Just let him try.


SCENE: FLASHBACK — TED’S APARTMENT, WEEKS EARLIER First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

It started with a smell. Vanilla. Faint. Like perfume worn by someone too proud to reapply. I was folding laundry, Liz in the kitchen, humming something saccharine and bland, when I caught it — the scent of a ghost. I stopped breathing for a second. Not Liz. Maris.

It’s wrong. I know it’s wrong. But I pulled a pair of Liz’s panties from the basket — peach cotton, elastic fraying — and buried my face in them like a dog. I inhaled for as long as I could. Soaking it in. All of it. And I imagined it was her. Not Liz. Her. The girl with the ice-pick voice and the soft skin. Silky, young, tight. The little untouched nymphet. The way she looked when she opened the door for me that night, soaked in moonlight, once the fluorescents were silenced. The way she let me inside her, the way she knelt for me, like it meant something. The way she tasted. Sweet. I could’ve spent hours just devouring it, but in that split second when her guard dropped and the pleasure took over, she looked so holy, so pristine, so innocent. I know that wasn’t a lie. She’d never had an orgasm before. I was so proud. I came fast, embarrassed, humiliated. She kissed me like it was amusing. I should’ve left. I should’ve walked out, kept what was left of my power. But I stayed. And worse — I begged.

She disappeared the next day. I called. Nothing. I wrote. Nothing. I even went by the estate. The maid said Miss Caldwell was indisposed. Indisposed my ass — she was hiding. Watching. Laughing. And I couldn’t get it out of my head. Her lips. Her thighs. The smirk. I couldn’t touch Liz without feeling like I was settling for garbage. I started resenting her face. Her smell. Her voice. The way she breathed. The way she loved me. It felt pathetic.

I followed Maris once. From the centre. She knew. She waved. Not a real wave — a twitch of her fingers. Like she was mocking me. I wanted to strangle her right there on the pavement. Just to see if she could smirk with a crushed windpipe. But instead I smiled. And watched her leave. I went home and fucked Liz with my eyes shut. Pretending. Always pretending.

And when it wasn’t enough — when Liz’s skin felt like latex and her voice made my teeth itch — I did what I had to do. I drove. I hunted. I found Brenda.

That night, I slept like a king.

---

SCENE: LIZ ALONE — LATER THAT NIGHT First Person – Liz Kloepfer’s POV

He’s asleep beside me. His back is turned. His breath even. Like nothing happened. Like I didn’t see my body dissected by a stranger. Like I didn’t learn what he really thinks of me — not in words, but in comparisons.

The photo is still in the drawer. I should’ve burned it. But I didn’t. I wanted to hold onto the proof. Because otherwise… what if I forget? What if he convinces me again? What if I wake up next week and he kisses my forehead, and I pretend this was all a fever dream?

Molly’s tucked in already. She asked why I looked sad at dinner. I told her I had a headache. I seem to get “headaches” quite often now. She offered to bring me a crayon. That hurt more than anything Ted said. Reminded me too much of the writing.

I lie there and I watch the shadows crawl across the ceiling. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t know who I am when I’m not looking at him. When he isn’t looking at me. When I’m not trying to be good enough. Young enough. Thin enough. Sweet enough. Safe enough.

There’s a bruise forming on my wrist. From when he grabbed me earlier. He let go. He always lets go. But every time, it takes a little longer. There’s a little more pressure. And I wonder what will happen when he doesn’t.

I glance at the phone. I could call someone. But who would believe me? The charming law student? The perfect boyfriend? No one sees the monster. They just see me.

And I already look like the kind of woman who would settle. Because I have.



SCENE: JULY 20, 1974 – VICTIM ONE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The university gym smells like effort. Salt, adrenaline and testosterone. A chemical cocktail I’ve come to enjoy — not for the sport, but for the bait. Men stripped of their suits and language, reduced to grunts and flexes and their best guess at masculinity. They’re always trying to impress someone.

Today, it’s me.

I’m in a pair of nylon shorts and a tank top I’ve knotted at the waist. No makeup, just Carmex and lashes curled to look accidental; the cheekbones and delicate nose do most of the heavy lifting. There’s a graze on my shin from my run this morning. A bruise from nothing in particular. A smudge of sweat that draws the eye to my collarbone.

I pretend to struggle with the water fountain. Tilt my head, toy with the handle. Wait for the right one.

He’s watching me.

Dark-haired. Six feet, maybe six-one. Blue eyes. Good teeth. Pre-med, if I had to guess — always slightly too eager to diagnose. He shifts his towel to the other shoulder, takes a step closer.

“You need any help?” he asks. The knight trying to save me from dehydration is the one with anxiety in his voice, like he’s scared of me.

I blink twice. “It’s jammed. Won’t turn.”

He tries it. It works instantly. Of course it does. It worked for me too, about thirty minutes ago when I did my dry run.

“You’ve got to, uh, press it down while angling the—yeah, like that.”

“Thanks,” I say, eyes wide like he’s just saved me from a fire, smile as genuine as I can muster. “I’m hopeless with these things.”

His laugh is a little too proud. He thinks we’re having a moment.

I let it build.

I ask for his name. Alex. His handshake is warm, fingers calloused. I pretend not to notice how much he looks like Ted. That’s part of the thrill — knowing and pretending not to. My own little inside joke.

We chat for seven minutes. I time it. I say I’m studying psych. He asks if I’ve ever analyzed him. I say I’m not qualified. He tells me I seem smart enough. The script pra

He offers to walk me out.

I say yes.

---

SCENE CONTINUATION: LATER THAT NIGHT – VICTIM ONE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

He doesn’t make it to the parking lot.

I cut him off at the science building — the old one, with the blacked-out corridor under construction. I giggle like a moronic sorority girl who forgot her ID card. “Can we just sneak through?” I say. “I swear it’s a shortcut.”

He follows. I tell him how chivalrous he is, that I’m afraid of the dark alone as a girl after what happened on campus and at Lake Sam. The tension’s been in the air, I tell him about my dear, sweet friend Carol.

I hold his hand like it means something. I lead him to the Corolla.

And then I stop.

He turns to say something — probably a joke, or an offer to carry my bag — but it’s too late.

The knife’s already in his side.

His eyes go wide. A gargle, a twitch. He tries to backpedal, slips. I clamp one hand over his mouth, press my body flush to his, and whisper in his ear, “This isn’t about you.”

Then I cut again.

Clean, fast. The final blow is almost clinical. He dies looking confused — like someone just ruined a date that was going really well.

I don’t smile.

Not yet. I pop the trunk as he sags against it, mustering the force to shove him inside.

I’m careful with the body. Wrap it in his gym towel. I know the janitor’s rounds. I know which lights are cut at what time. The car’s hideous but useful, engine humming, trunk slammed shut.

I drive out of campus like I’m coming back from dinner. Check my lipstick at the red light. Tap the wheel to whatever’s on the radio.

The corpse doesn’t make a sound.

I glance in the rearview.

For a moment — just a flicker — I see Ted’s face instead.

Then it fades.

Alex is dead.

But one isn’t enough.

I’m just getting started.


SCENE: JULY 20, 1974 – GREENHOUSE CLEAN-UP First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The Corolla rolls to a halt behind the greenhouse. No lights. No prying eyes. Only the hum of cicadas and the occasional rustle of leaves — a sound I’ve always found soothing. Nature pretending not to notice what I’m about to do.

I back the car in with surgical precision. Alex is still warm. It makes the lift easier — deadweight, yes, but not stiff yet. I brace my knee against the bumper and haul him out by the armpits. His head lolls, lip parted in a faint echo of confusion. Still trying to understand how we went from flirting to this.

I lay him down on the tarp I’d prepped earlier. Pale blue. Vinyl. Same type used for covering furniture or corpses. I press my hand to his chest.

Still no heartbeat.

Good.

I unroll the rest of the tarp. Start with the wrists. Zip ties. Then ankles. Wrap him tight, mummy-style. This part’s practical, not pleasurable — no theatre, no flourish. I’ve done this before. There’s a rhythm to it.

The greenhouse is warm, damp, reeking of chlorophyll and decay. It masks the blood smell, but just barely. I adjust the humidifier. The begonias near the back are wilting. I should tend to them. Maybe tomorrow.

I strip off my tank top, peel away the shorts. Everything goes into the garbage bag, along with his towel. I scrub my hands with surgical wipes, then hydrogen peroxide. No gloves tonight. I like to feel the life leave them.

I lean against the metal shelf and exhale.

That was good.

Not perfect — the shoulder wound was a little too messy — but good. Clean entry. Quick. No teeth marks, no scratches. Nothing for them to test.

Except—

My thumb. A faint red streak near the nail. I bite it clean. Spit into the drain. Recheck every inch of my body. No trace.

I change into a fresh silk slipdress from the laundry pile. Pale blue, like the tarp. The irony isn’t lost on me.

Then I call Stephen. I reach his answering machine. I leave a message asking him for help, mentioning the greenhouse project. I hang it back up.

I step over Alex’s body. Open the far cabinet where I keep the lye.

I hum as I measure the powder.

Something French.

Something sweet.

---

SCENE: JULY 21, 1974 – MARIS’S BATHROOM, EARLY MORNING First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

I scrub until my skin flakes.

The water’s gone cold, but I don’t care. My nails are chipped. There’s blood under one of them, just barely — a ghost of it. I dig it out with a sewing pin. The sting makes me smile.

The mirror is fogged. I wipe it with the back of my hand and stare at the girl who looks back.

She looks satisfied.

Hair wet, face clean, body humming from exertion. No makeup. No mask. Just me. The real me. The most beautiful version of me.

An executioner.

I brush my teeth twice. Rinse with saltwater. Check my tongue, my gums, my throat. The taste of copper is gone, but the memory isn’t. It never is.

I pull on a robe. Step into my bedroom.

Millie is asleep in her room. Or pretending to be. She’s been quieter lately. Good. She knows I’m done entertaining her little loyalty experiments.

Stephen hasn’t phoned me back.

Not yet.

He will. He always does.

I drop onto the chaise, stretch out, light a clove cigarette. The room smells of bleach and vanilla and the faintest trace of something darker.

Under the bed: Alex’s gym bag, untouched. I’ll burn it tomorrow. Maybe dump it in the lake.

I close my eyes.

The high is still here, but it’s different now.

Not adrenaline.

Not lust.

Power.

Control.

Godlike precision.

I can already feel it fading.

Which means it’s time for lucky victim number two. But I have something to take care of first.


SCENE: JULY 20, 1974 – TED’S ROOMING HOUSE, SEATTLE (EARLIER) First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

It’s not the first time I’ve broken into a man’s bedroom, but it might be the first time I’ve done it with a head in my handbag.

Not the whole handbag, of course. That would be uncouth. Just the upper portion, wrapped in silk, then plastic, then silk again — the way you might gift-wrap a bottle of perfume or your mother’s favourite brooch. I’m not sentimental. I just believe in presentation.

The street is dead. Not even a porch light flickers. I paid Jose’s cousin to drive me. No questions asked. I tip well when I need silence, and fear handles the rest.

Ted’s landlady is consistent. Asleep by 9:30. Takes a Xanax and two sherries. Calls it her “evening meditation.” I watched her routine for three days. Even made her favourite lemon bars so I could get inside once, just to check the locks. Sweet woman. Lonely. Wears slippers shaped like geese.

I let myself in through the side door. The one with the sticky hinge and no deadbolt. It squeaks if you open it too fast, so I don’t.

Second floor. Left side. Third door down.

It’s not locked.

I pause. That part’s unexpected.

Ted is obsessive about order. About security. The illusion of control. He probably double-checked the knob before leaving, then checked it again just to be sure. That means he was spiralling when he left. Distracted. Unraveling.

Perfect.

I open it quietly. The room is exactly what I imagined — drab, dusty, and stifling. A place where secrets go to rot. There’s a desk, a bed, and a pile of yellowing books with titles like Man and His Symbols. He thinks it makes him look deep. Mostly, it makes him look poor.

I put on gloves.

From my bag, I lift the package.

The head is still warm. That’s how you know it’s fresh. A little too fresh, really. If I weren’t in such a hurry, I’d have aged it slightly. Set it out in the greenhouse for a few hours. Let it lose that tacky, alive sheen.

But no — I want him to see it like this.

New. Personal. Perfect.

I lay it on his pillow like a love note. Or a threat. Or both.

Then the fun part: I open the lipstick. Revlon’s Fire & Ice. He liked it when I wore it. Said it looked “classic.” Said it reminded him of someone. (He meant Diane. He always means Diane.)

I lean in and write it across the forehead: HE’S JUST YOUR TYPE.

Then I kiss the cheek. A big, wet print. Smudge it a little, for effect.

I light a cigarette. Not to smoke — I hate the smell. I just want to leave it tucked behind the ear like a final flourish. Ted does it sometimes. Thinks it makes him look rakish. Really, it makes him look like he’s trying too hard.

The finishing touch.

I step back. Admire my work.

It’s beautiful, really. The symmetry. The horror. The intimacy. Most women leave hair in the sink. I leave trauma.

I check the window — still locked. No prints. No mess. I close the door behind me, wipe the knob with a tissue, and disappear down the stairs.

As I slip out through the back, I wonder how long it’ll take him to scream.

Probably not long.

But that’s the thing about predators.

They’re never prepared to be prey.




SCENE: JULY 20, 1974 – TED’S ROOMING HOUSE, SEATTLE

First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

The house is quiet when I get back. It always is. Mrs. Rogers is asleep by 9:30, and the tenant next door never leaves his room unless something’s burning. I like it that way — silence and secrecy. It’s the only place I can breathe. The only place that’s mine, unencumbered by women and the clutter they bring.

I lock the front door. Climb the stairs. Second floor. Left side. Third door down. My hand is on the knob before I realize the door is slightly ajar.

That’s wrong. I always lock it. Always. Without fail.

I push it open slowly. No sign of force. Nothing overturned. Everything looks the same. The bed. The desk. The lamp with the flickering bulb. Except—

I stop.

There’s something on my pillow.

No — someone.

I move closer. My chest is tight. My mouth dry. It’s a head. A male head.

Hair combed back. Skin clean. Young. Freckled. Lips painted a glossy red, precise and wet. There's lipstick smudged across the cheek like someone kissed it, hard. One eyelid is half-shut. The other bulges wide open, staring at the ceiling like it saw God coming and didn’t like the look of him.

And the face—

Jesus Christ.

It looks like me.

Not exactly. But enough. The jaw. The mouth. The arch of the brows. It’s like someone went shopping for my replacement and settled for a second-rate duplicate.

There’s a cigarette tucked behind the left ear. And on the forehead, written in lipstick: “HE’S JUST YOUR TYPE.”

I stumble back.

What the fuck— What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck—

My knees hit the mattress and I retch. Nothing comes up. My stomach’s full of bile and fear. It’s real. The head is real. Still warm. The smell—sweet, metallic, unmistakable. It’s a fucking mirror. A shrine. An insult.

She’s been here. In my room. She walked inside my sanctum and didn’t flinch.

I glance at the windows. Still locked from the inside. No prints. No signs. Of course not. She’s too good for that.

My hands are shaking. This wasn’t a message. This was a performance.

I get up. Walk around the bed. There’s no note this time. No envelope. Just the goddamn thing lying there like a pillow mint. Like she left it for me to kiss goodnight.

The lipstick — it’s the same shade she wore the night she vanished on me. Red, glossy, just a bit cheap.

I can hear her voice in my head. You’re not the only one who brings home souvenirs.

She’s mocking me. Mimicking me. Improving on me.

I want to scream.

I want to bury the head in the yard and set the fucking house on fire. But I can’t. Because if I do, I draw attention. And I know how this works — attention means inquiry. Inquiry means exposure. Exposure means death.

I’m trapped. Inside my own fucking methods. This sick, sadistic little bitch.

She knows. She knows everything.

And worst of all?

She’s now ahead. Not just in her delusional world. Because now it’s not just her fingerprints I’m looking for. It’s mine.


SCENE: JULY 21, 1974 – CAPITOL HILL

First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

This one wears cologne. Too much of it. Obvious. Like he read in a magazine that girls like musk and forgot to read past the headline. I don’t ask his name. I don’t need it, and soon, neither will he. He’s tall — not quite Hunter-tall, but close enough that I don’t feel small next to him. His hair’s a little long. Chocolate brown. Side-parted. There’s a curl that flops forward when he talks about his motorcycle. Cornflower blue eyes that want to swallow me whole.

He thinks I’m impressed. I let him think it.

We’re standing outside a coffee shop near Broadway. He asked if I wanted a drink and I said no — told him I’d just come from Canlis and had espresso with dessert. He didn’t know what Canlis was. That’s how I knew he’d follow me anywhere.

He keeps adjusting his sleeves, the way Ted does. Little compulsive tugs at the wrist. He doesn’t realise he’s auditioning. I’ve already chosen him.

“Where are we headed?” he asks, trying to sound cool. He’s walking beside me now, hands in pockets, not realising I’ve already slowed my pace so I can see how his gait matches Ted’s. It’s a little off — heavier on the left foot. A sprain, maybe. Football injury. Doesn’t matter. He’ll be symmetrical enough on his back.

“Just down here,” I say, smiling. “There’s a greenhouse behind my friend’s place. I need help moving something.”

He’s a little confused. “Like what?”

“Something heavy,” I say lightly. “You don’t mind helping a girl out, do you?”

He grins. Puffed up. Predictable. I love them when they’re stupid. Most men are, they just enjoy living in delusion.

We round the corner. The alley is dark but not suspicious. The kind of place that still smells like wet paint from a recent city touch-up. There’s a neon sign flickering above an abandoned storefront — red, then white, then off.

I glance behind me.

No one’s followed. No one ever does. They assume beauty has an escort, not a hunting knife.

He makes some half-comment about the moon — something half-formed and poetic and too embarrassed to finish. I stop walking. Turn to face him.

“Do you think I’m pretty?” It comes out like a dare.

He laughs. “Of course. I mean, look at you.”

I reach for him.

He thinks it’s a kiss.

And that’s his last thought before his throat is slit from ear to ear.


SCENE INSERT: JULY 21, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, NIGHT

First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The house smells like roses. Not real ones — Quinn’s kind. French. Cloying. Overbred. There’s a vase in every room, replenished weekly by some company with a name like Petal & Thorn. Daddy pays the invoice, like always. I let them rot when no one’s home. Dead flowers make better metaphors anyway.

The television is on in the background. The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Season One rerun. The one where Lou thinks he’s getting fired. Says he’s 45, washed up, tired of the “you’re still young” routine. I watch as Mary sits across from him, knees tucked, eyes wide. That worried-pixie look women weaponize when they want to seem small. I’ve used it. Still do, when it suits me.

I’m on the rug with my tools. Velvet box. Twine. Tissue. The kind of packaging Liz would use if she ever learned to spell my name. There’s a little smear of blood on the satin liner — not enough to ruin it, just enough to stain the memory. It smells faintly of sweat and antiseptic. I’d wiped it down. I’m not careless.

The penis is cooling in the refrigerator, beneath a layer of wax paper between the foie gras and the strawberries. Cook’s off until Tuesday. No one will notice.

I check the shape again. Freckle placement, skin tone, curvature — I studied. The model wasn’t perfect, but I made adjustments. A little tweak here, a little more pressure during extraction. It’s not the real thing, of course. But it’s close enough that he’ll check his own in panic.

I line the base with tissue. Place it gently, like a communion wafer. Then come the finishing touches: the red lipstick note, the kiss mark, the careful scrawl of Theodore Cowell. His birth name. His shame name. I dot the “i” with a flick. Feminine. Exacting. Intimate.

Mary’s voice breaks through again:

“You know what? You’re gonna make it after all.”

I glance at the screen. The hat flies into the air. Cue the freeze-frame. I always thought that moment was a little manic. Joy that borders on hysteria. Kind of like what men feel when they think they’ve gotten away with something.

I stand. Seal the package. The box is beautiful. Artful. Laced with horror and silk comedy. I place it in a tote bag beside an innocent bottle of Chanel No. 5 and a paperback Hunter has been pretending to read. I’m still not convinced he can read at all.

Tomorrow, it’ll be on Ted’s doorstep. And for a few seconds — just a few — I hope he squeals like a little girl.




SCENE INSERT: JULY 22, 1974 – THE ROOMING HOUSE

First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

There’s a package. Brown butcher paper. Twine-wrapped. No address. No postage. Just “Theodore Cowell” scrawled across the front in red lipstick — not ink — lipstick. A single kiss mark beside it. Faint. Pressed with precision. The mailbox hadn’t had it an hour ago. I’ve been monitoring it with hawklike vigilance. Someone came by.

My stomach tightens.

I take it upstairs. Shut the door. Deadbolt clicks. I open it slowly.

Inside is a velvet-lined box. Like something that would house a bracelet, a timepiece, something delicate and masculine. There’s tissue paper. Pale pink. And nestled in the centre — A severed penis.

Still moist. Pale. Flaccid. Not unlike my own. The foreskin curled like a sneer. A single black eyelash trapped in a coagulated glob near the base.

I recoil. But not far. Because taped beneath it is a note — In the same red lipstick:

“Tell me again who’s in control.”

I stare. I don’t breathe. My hands start to tremble.

It looks like mine. Even the shape. The freckle on the side. For one terrible second, I believe it is. I look down at my own crotch — frantic, disoriented, like a boy waking from a wet nightmare — before the rational part of my brain kicks in.

It’s not mine. It’s just made to look like it.

But she knew. She studied me. Enough to match detail for detail.

And now I’m sick.

I drop it. I fall back onto the bed. The mattress doesn’t even creak. It just exhales, like it’s tired of holding me up. I’m tired of being here. I can’t remember when I last slept, the circles beneath my eyes deeper than I’ve ever seen.


SCENE: JULY 22, 1974 – A BLOCK AWAY, SAME TIME

First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

I see him find it. The box is small, delicate — the kind of thing a debutante might receive from a lover before cotillion. But this isn’t that kind of present. And he isn’t that kind of man.

From the safety of Jose’s Corolla (again — I really ought to tip him better), I watch Ted take the parcel inside like it’s something sacred. He hesitates at the door. Looks behind him. He knows. He knows it’s from me.

I light a cigarette and roll down the window, just enough for the smoke to thread into the dusk like incense before a ritual.

He disappears into the rooming house. One minute. Two. Then I see the curtain twitch. He’s there — frozen, hunched, looking down at the contents like they’ve redefined reality.

I already know which part got him.

It’s not the lipstick. Not the eyelash. Not even the velvet lining. It’s the shape. The uncanny resemblance. A mirror. Of himself.

I picture the moment his brain tries to reconcile it — the horror of seeing his manhood, his entire power source, divorced from his body. Reduced to meat. Displayed. Mocked.

I can’t help it. I howl. I laugh so hard I fold over the steering wheel, tears leaking down my cheeks. My ribs ache. My jaw cramps. I howl like an animal. Like something feral that just won.

Because this is what he does to women. And now — he gets to feel it.

The dehumanisation. The objectification. The implication that what he is… is disposable.

And he can’t call the police. He can’t cry to the landlady. He can’t tell Liz. Because then they’d have to ask why there’s a matching head under the floorboards. Or why his bedroom smells like mortuary slop.

No. He’ll stew. He’ll shiver. He’ll wonder how long I’ve been watching him dress, undress, unzip. And that’s the most delicious part.

I suck the last drag of the cigarette, flick it onto the gravel, and start the engine.

He thinks this was a message. It wasn’t.

I just enjoy foreplay.


irst Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

The centre smells like a police station. Paper cups. Sour instant coffee. A trace of bleach, like someone tried to clean the air but didn’t mean it. There’s always a draft here. It snakes around your ankles like guilt. My skirts stay short.

Stephen’s by the resource shelf, restocking pamphlets like they’ll save a life. Sweet boy. Idiotic, but sweet.

He’s in full costume tonight.

Tweed jacket. Elbow patches. White shirt, navy tie, slightly crooked. Patent leather shoes — glossy, inappropriate for this job, and expensive enough to suggest someone else paid.

I slide into the seat beside him.

He startles. “Sorry,” I murmur. “Didn’t mean to creep up on you.” He smiles — sheepish, open. “Oh — it’s okay. I was just logging the new pamphlets from Olympia.”

I nod vaguely. As if anything printed on Xerox paper could stop someone from swallowing pills.

My gaze drifts to his profile.

That haircut. Short. Slick. The side part now disciplined instead of soft. And the shoes — too formal. They shine like they were polished for someone else’s funeral.

“You’ve changed,” I say. Not a question.

Stephen blushes. “Yeah — uh, yeah. New cut. Jacket’s borrowed. And the shoes — I know they’re too much, but I thought—” “You wanted to look important.” He blinks. “What?” “Nothing.”

The lights above us buzz like they’re thinking too hard.

Across the room, someone’s muttering into a hotline phone.

Then I lean in. Just enough for him to smell my skin.

“You know,” I whisper, “you walk like you’ve got a secret now. Like you’ve been places.” He laughs nervously. “That’s… good?” “I think it is. Confidence suits you.” I pause.

Then lower my voice. “You know who you remind me of?” He’s too scared to ask, but I tell him anyway. “A senator’s aide. Ivy League. Maybe even a senator.”

Stephen doesn’t know whether to smile or shrink.

“You should go darker,” I say. “Hair. Eyes. It’ll make them wonder what you’re hiding.”

He looks down at his hands, then back at me.

“You really think I look like someone?”

“I think you look like someone who could disappear someone.” I flash a smile. He takes it as flirtation.

It’s not.

It’s prophecy.






SCENE: JULY 1974 — VICTIM THREE: EYES AND SOCK First Person — Maris Caldwell’s POV

The third one is perfect.

He’s younger than the others — maybe nineteen, maybe twenty. A frat pledge. Same nose as Ted. Same haircut, even. Stiff posture, like someone who hasn’t learned that confidence isn’t earned, it’s stolen. Or like he’s got a stick up his rear. I spot him leaving the bookstore with a paperback about Nietzsche. As if that’s going to give him a personality. He holds the book like it means something.

I decide I’ll take the eyes.

He doesn’t scream the way I thought he would. It’s mostly gurgling — throat half crushed, one hand pawing at the air like a dying bird. I keep it efficient. There’s no eroticism here. No prolonged taunting. I already had my fun with the first two.

This one’s a message.

He’s in my greenhouse now. The gloves are on. The shears are sharpened. I don’t flinch when I take the eyes out. I’ve done worse. It’s clinical — two pale marbles in my palm. Wet. Still blinking. They look like Ted’s when he’s begging me to stay.

I tuck them into the plush bear I lifted from a child’s toy bin last week. Millie used to love these when we were little — she'd cry if hers went missing. I gut it from the neck and feed them in, one by one, into the sockets. They rest there unnaturally, just a little crooked. Glassy. Staring.

I stitch the bear back up. Sloppy on purpose. Visible thread. Surgical red. I kiss its forehead and whisper, “Tell Daddy I said hi.”

Now for the pièce de résistance.

I stole one of Ted’s socks three nights ago. White. Mid-calf. The kind he stacks in neurotic rolls, like a military housewife. He’s obsessed with keeping them matched. If even one is out of place, he notices. I took one from the back row, the least likely to be touched — until now.

I roll it up, press it deep into the victim’s mouth. The irony is divine. He’ll think I’m gagging him postmortem. I’m not. I’m feeding him Ted. Letting them meet, in a way. Introducing predator to prey.

By the time I’m finished, the body is cold. I leave it posed like a doll — knees bent, arms slack, mouth agape, sock still visible if you look closely enough.

The bear sits next to his head, eyes gleaming.

A matched set.

A mockery.

I wipe down the tools. Burn the gloves. Then I walk out like I just returned a library book.

---

SCENE SHIFT: JULY 1974 — TED BUNDY’S BEDROOM, ROOMING HOUSE First Person — Ted Bundy’s POV

One of my socks is missing.

I know it. I’m not crazy. They’re folded in eights, always, front row to back. I keep the top left row for the ones I wear most, the back row for emergencies. And this — this space — it’s wrong.

It wasn’t yesterday. But now? There’s a hole in the order. A breach. Someone’s been in here.

My scalp prickles.

I tear through the drawer. Check the floor. The laundry. I didn’t misplace it. I don’t lose things.

Unless—

Unless it was taken.

There’s a knock downstairs. Someone’s left a package. No return address. Again.

I tear it open on the stairs. Just a teddy bear.

A child’s toy.

Except it’s staring at me.

Eyes. Real ones.

Mine.

No.

No, no — not mine, but close enough to pass in a mirror. Blue. Wide. Human.

Inside the mouth is something white.

I press my fingers in.

My sock.

One of my socks.

I stagger back. I feel bile in my throat.

She was here.

She was in my room. Again.

She touched my things. My socks. My fucking socks.

She’s taunting me with trophies — hers and mine.

And the worst part?

I feel it again.

That same high.

That same hunger.

But this time, it’s laced with fear.

She’s not just matching me. She’s crowding me. She’s humiliating me. She needs to see what happens to women who humiliate me.


SCENE: JULY 25, 1974 – SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT, HOMICIDE DIVISION Third Person – Detective Mitchell’s POV

The board’s getting crowded. Three girls missing, all from within fifteen miles of each other. One girl dead — dismembered, genitals mutilated. Another’s skull found in the woods. Another found with eyes removed and a teddy bear beside her.

Detective John Mitchell rubs his temples. The fluorescent lights above hum too loud, too bright. Every time he blinks, the bear’s eyes flash in his memory — blue, real, stitched into polyester.

“This is personal,” he says to no one in particular. “This is ritual. Escalation.”

He knows the signs. Knows the profile. Except this doesn’t feel like a man.

There’s no semen. No staging. No manic compulsion to revisit the scene. It’s too clean. Too precise.

“We need to start looking at women,” he mutters, mostly to provoke the room.

The others chuckle.

But Mitchell doesn’t.

Because something’s wrong here. And the deeper he digs, the more it feels like they’re chasing smoke.

---

SCENE: JULY 25, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, MILLIE’S ROOM First Person – Millicent Caldwell’s POV

I haven’t slept in two nights.

Maris won’t answer my calls.

She used to at least pretend to love me. Let me into her dressing room, hand me her castoffs, smile when I mirrored her lipstick. But now? Nothing.

I sit in the dark, knees hugged to my chest, staring at the rotary phone like it’s a Ouija board. If I stare long enough, maybe it’ll conjure her.

I think she’s punishing me. For going to the police. For wanting her to stop.

I didn’t mean to ruin anything. I just— I just wanted her to see me.

I press the phone to my cheek and close my eyes.

“Mare…” I whisper. “Please call me.”

Nothing.

Only silence. And the sick knowledge that somewhere, she’s doing it again. And maybe she’ll never need me again.

---

SCENE: JULY 25, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, LIBRARY Third Person – Henry Caldwell’s POV

Henry doesn’t ask questions.

Not about the blood-streaked gloves he found balled up behind the greenhouse. Not about the sudden shortage of sharp shears. Not about the three pairs of shoes Maris asked to have burned.

He simply calls his man in District Records and ensures there’s no mention of her.

It’s what fathers do.

Or at least, it’s what this father does.

He pours a scotch — top shelf — and watches his daughter from the French windows. She’s walking along the edge of the fountain, arms outstretched like a child.

She hasn’t smiled like that in years.

Whatever she’s doing… It’s keeping her calm.

He takes a sip and leans back in his chair.

The world can go to hell. As long as his sweet girl is happy.


SCENE: JULY 25, 1974 – CALDWELL ESTATE, MASTER SUITE First Person – Millicent Caldwell’s POV

Mother’s having her hair set. I knock anyway.

She doesn’t look at me when she opens the door. Just waves a manicured hand like I’m a maid with bad timing. She’s in silk — always — with her honey-coloured hair clipped in tortoiseshell. The smell of Shalimar fogs the room like an accusation.

“Mother,” I say quietly.

“I told you not to knock during treatment.”

“I just—” My voice cracks. “I haven’t seen Maris. Not for days. I think something’s—”

“Wrong?” she finishes, finally turning. Her eyes scan me the way they scan produce at the market — too soft, too bruised, not worth the price.

“Yes.”

“Then maybe she’s bored of you.”

I flinch.

She returns to the mirror. “Maris is busy. Important girls are busy. You could learn from that.”

“She’s hurting people, Mother.”

Quinn scoffs. “Oh please, Millie. You always did have a flair for drama.”

“I think she might be killing them.”

There’s a pause. Not long. But long enough to mean something.

Quinn powders her nose. “Then thank God your father adores her. Because if anyone were going to get away with it…” She tilts her head. “It wouldn’t be you.”

I stand there. Stunned. Unseen.

“She’s your daughter too.”

“No,” Quinn says, sharp now. “You are my daughter.” Then she closes the door.

---

SCENE: JULY 26, 1974 – SUICIDE CRISIS CENTRE, FRONT DESK Third Person – Detective Mitchell’s POV

It smells like toner and desperation.

The woman behind the desk — gum-popping, over-permed, name tag says Cheryl — flips through the sign-in log like she’s doing him a favour.

“I told your partner last week, we don’t exactly keep detailed records. Volunteers come in, they sign the sheet, they answer phones. We’re not NASA.”

Mitchell keeps his tone even. “You said a Maris Caldwell works here?”

“Yeah, her and that kid with the sad eyes. What’s his name — Stephen? Real sweet, real jumpy.”

“Anyone else comment on their behaviour?”

She chews louder. “She’s a knockout. Bit cold. But the old guys around here don’t care. They’d lick battery acid off her shoes if she asked nice.”

Mitchell raises a brow. “And the boy?”

Cheryl leans in. “He’s been dressing different. Like he’s trying to impress someone. Creepy, almost. Got that Bundy look, y’know?”

Mitchell goes still. Heart ticks once. Hard.

“You mean… Ted Bundy?”

She shrugs. “Yeah. He used to volunteer here too. Before he got too busy. They were always circling each other, those two. Like a pair of snakes.”

Mitchell closes his notepad.

“Thank you,” he says.

His mind is already sprinting.


SCENE: JULY 26, 1974 – CALDWELL GREENHOUSE First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

Something’s off. Not wrong — not yet — but off.

I feel it in the air when I step outside. The birdsong stops too quickly. The breeze cuts too sharp. Even the soil smells different — not rot, not blood, just… interruption. Like someone’s been here.

I double-check the locks. The traps. The cabinet where I keep the leftover bones. Nothing’s moved. But I still feel watched.

Then there’s Millie. Hovering like a kicked dog. Flinching whenever I pass. Crying in her room like it’s going to solve something. I hear her whispering on the phone last night. Saying my name. The words ‘she scares me.’

She should.

And then Father, quieter than usual. He hasn’t asked what I’ve done with the greenhouse keys. That’s not like him. He always wants to know everything. Unless… Unless he doesn’t want to know.

People are pulling away. Or leaning in too close. I don’t like either.

I spot a newspaper clipping left on the kitchen bench this morning — an article about rising campus disappearances. Circled. Twice. No note. Just left out like a baited hook.

Someone’s poking around. I don’t know who yet. But I do know this — Before the trail leads here, I’ll divert it.

Back to Ted. Back to his life. His family.

If someone wants to play bloodhound, I’ll make sure they chase the wrong scent. Time to become a Bundy.




SCENE: JULY 1974 – THE CRISIS CENTRE First Person — Ted Bundy’s POV

He walks past the window before I recognise him.

Brown hair now. Cut short and clean. Not quite a side part, but close. He’s wearing a tan sportscoat — tweed, elbow patches, like mine — and black patent leather shoes. A little shiny for the setting, but that’s the point, isn’t it? A little off. A little too much effort. The kind of outfit I wore when I still cared what people thought.

Then he turns.

And my stomach drops.

It’s me.

Almost.

Not exactly — no, the jaw’s a touch softer, the ears are uneven, and his nose has that turned-up, rodent thing. But at a glance? From ten feet away? It’s enough.

Enough to make me feel like I’ve been duplicated.

Copied.

Mimicked.

And I don’t like it.

He used to be a fucking wreck — that twitchy redhead with sweat stains and bad posture. The one who looked like he got dressed in a panic. Maris used to ignore him. We all did. Now he’s got her attention.

I know it. I see it.

She laughs more when he’s around. Leans in when he speaks. Once, I saw her brush lint off his lapel. That same gentle, surgical touch she used on me.

And now he’s got my face.

I watch him through the glass as he signs in. Left-handed, like me. He even hunches the same way when he writes. She taught him that. Had to have. The details are too specific.

My throat dries.

This isn’t flattery.

This is invasion.

He’

My fists curl without permission.

I want to walk in and slam his head into the desk. I want to break his nose so he never resembles me again. But instead I smile. I nod. I hold the mask.

Stephen.

That’s his name.

I hadn’t thought of him as a threat.

I do now.

---

SCENE CONTINUATION: MARIS’S POV — WATCHING FROM THE STAIRWELL

He’s really getting there.

The shoes were my idea. The coat, too. The haircut — I showed him a reference photo from GQ and told him he had “a jawline for the 70s.” He laughed. Said no one had ever complimented his face before. I told him he needed darker hair — red’s too loud, makes people not trust you. “Brunette men get more power,” I said. He dyed it that night.

Now he looks like someone who strangles co-eds in a dream.

I love it.

Especially because Ted doesn’t.

I see the twitch in his jaw when they stand side by side. The silent fury behind his teeth. He knows this isn’t coincidence.

It’s mimicry.

Manufactured resemblance.

And worst of all?

Stephen doesn’t even know.

He thinks he’s finally becoming someone. In reality, he’s just my carbon clone of the man I’m going to destroy.

Let Ted watch. Let him stew. Let him see his own face distorted in the skin of a better servant.

SCENE: THE IMITATION – LATE JULY 1974 First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

I’ve always loved the way men change shape when you show them attention. They adapt. Mold. They start tilting their heads like yours, pacing when you pace. Some call it empathy. I call it puppetry.

Stephen used to hunch. He used to apologize when he spoke. Red hair like rust. Acne scars. A thrift store wardrobe that even charity bins would reject. He wore a pea-green Volkswagen like a badge of poverty, always half a tank from asking his mother for cash.

Not anymore.

Now he drives a tan Bug. Same year, same body as Ted’s. Parked three spaces down from the centre. The resemblance is so uncanny it makes my skin fizz. I made sure he understood it wasn’t just a car — it was an aesthetic. A persona.

“I like how it makes you look,” I’d told him, brushing lint from his lapel. He’d blinked too many times. “How?” “Like someone who gets things done.” He bought it two days later.

The speech was harder. I had to break him open and pour someone else in. I played tapes — not of Ted, of course, but of Nixon, of lawyers, of men who performed clarity. Measured tones. I made him practice intonation. Told him to drop the filler words. Told him the way he said “uhm” made him sound like a boy asking for permission to speak.

Now, he pauses before he answers. Keeps his hands folded. Makes too much eye contact. Ted’s still better at it — he has that born-to-deceive cadence — but Stephen’s catching up.

He mirrors him. It’s subtle at first. The way he holds his coffee. The way he nods once when he enters a room. The shoes — patent leather now. Same as Bundy’s. I even caught him smoothing his eyebrows in the mirror last week.

But the real test came when I asked him to lie. To pretend he was somewhere he wasn’t. To rehearse, out loud, a version of himself that didn’t exist.

He did it beautifully. Deadpan. Blank-eyed. Like a man confessing to something he didn’t quite remember doing.

“What time did you leave the park that day?” I asked him. He tilted his head — Ted’s exact angle. “Just after four. I saw her by the water fountain. She smiled.” “Did she get in the car?” A pause. A blink. “She wanted a ride.”

“And you gave her one?” “I didn’t mean to scare her.” The hairs on my arm rose.

I smiled. “You didn’t.”

He has no idea what he’s becoming. But when the walls close in — and they will — he’ll be the name they whisper. Not Bundy. Not Caldwell. Stephen Brady.

And I’ll make sure he thanks me for it.


SCENE: THE SKETCH

Mid-July 1974 – Ted’s Apartment – First Person – Elizabeth (Liz) Kendall’s POV

It comes in a plain white envelope. No return address. No note. Just the sketch.

At first, I think it’s a prank — or worse, some twisted joke from the crisis centre. I’ve seen enough missing posters to know what they usually look like. This isn’t one.

This is a composite drawing. Broad shoulders. Tan complexion. Parted hair. The face is... familiar.

I squint.

Then I see it.

The jaw. The shoes. The slight slouch in the posture. It looks like—

Stephen.

Not exactly. Not perfectly. But close enough that I have to sit down. The sketch lists “Lake Sammamish” at the top. Two girls missing. One confirmed abduction. I remember that day. It was in the papers. Everyone thought the suspect was someone charming. Educated. Not the usual drifter.

My hands are sweating.

I don’t know why I bring it to Ted. Some part of me still believes he’ll know what to do — even as the rest of me is screaming that this is something he doesn’t want me to see.

He opens the envelope and stares at it for a long time.

Too long.

“Do you... recognise him?” I ask gently.

He doesn’t look at me. “No.”

“That’s weird. Doesn’t it look like Stephen from the centre?”

He finally meets my eyes. “You think every white guy looks the same?”

“I didn’t say that.”

He sets the sketch down on the table like it’s hot to the touch. “It’s not me, Liz.”

“I never said it was you.”

“Then what’s the point of this?”

“I just—” I falter. “Someone sent it to my address, Ted. And you’re the only person I know who’s involved in this kind of thing.”

He laughs, short and bitter. “Yeah. I volunteer to help people and now I’m the bad guy.”

“I didn’t say you were the bad guy.”

He stands abruptly. “Maybe I should stop volunteering. Seems like a waste of time when people start throwing around accusations.”

I hate how fast I go quiet. How small I feel when he’s angry. I try to recover.

“I just thought it was strange,” I say. “Stephen has changed so much. His car, the shoes, the way he talks — I thought you’d noticed too.”

He doesn’t answer.

Then, colder: “Why are you even paying attention to Stephen?”

“I’m not. I just...”

“You think he’s becoming me?”

“No. I mean—maybe. I don’t know.”

He picks up the sketch again, folds it in half, then in half again. “It’s nonsense.”

“I believe you,” I lie.

He throws it in the trash.

I make a mental note of that.

When I leave, I pretend everything’s fine. I kiss his cheek. I tell him to have a good night.

But in the car, I turn the heater on full blast — even though it’s still the middle of summer — because I can’t stop shaking.


SCENE: THE SPARK

July 1974 – Caldwell Estate – First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

She doesn’t see me, of course.

She’s too focused on not crying.

Her knuckles are white against the steering wheel. I count seven full-body shudders before she even starts the ignition. Then she sits there, blowing warm air into her own face like it might dry the panic.

The envelope is gone. I assume it’s in her purse now, folded and cursed like a page torn from a witch’s diary.

It wasn’t hard. I stole a spare sketch off the bulletin board at the centre. Had Stephen sign me in, then slipped it into her mailbox while he was talking to Ted about training hours. I sealed it with pink tape, just to throw her. To make it seem childish. Or female. Women always assume their enemies wear lipstick.

She pulls out of the lot too fast. Her tires squeal. She’ll lie about the visit if anyone asks — maybe say she brought Ted cookies, or wanted to talk about volunteer hours.

But I know that face. I’ve seen it in mirrors, on pillows, in courtrooms and confessionals.

That’s the face of a woman afraid she’s right.

Stephen’s going to be a very convenient problem.

And she’s just become a very convenient witness.

SCENE: THE BEND Ted Bundy’s POV – Interior monologue

She’s starting to look at me differently.

Not with suspicion — with recognition. Like she sees something crawling beneath the skin and doesn’t know whether to name it or run.

That sketch… it wasn’t me. Not really. Not the way I am now. But it was close enough to feel like a trap. I didn’t build Stephen. I didn’t want a mirror. I don’t need a double. I need control.

And Maris — she’s laughing at me. I can feel it.

If Liz sees it, others will too. That’s the real danger. That I’ll become just another face in the crowd. Indistinct. Erasable.

I’ll kill someone tonight just to remind the world who I am.

But first... I have to deal with the other Caldwell girl.




SCENE ONE: MILLIE RETURNS — THE SEDUCTION ATTEMPT

July 1974 – Caldwell Estate – Evening Third Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

He isn’t expecting her.

He’s only met her once.

She answers the door before he can knock — barefoot, freckled, draped in a soft blue slip that’s either borrowed or stolen from Maris. Her hair is slightly damp, like she’s tried to look effortless and failed. She blinks at him like he’s the one intruding. Then she smiles.

“Oh,” she says, stepping aside. “You came.”

Ted hesitates. There’s a familiarity in her eyes, but it’s dislocated — like seeing Maris’s reflection in a warped mirror. This girl’s posture is too collapsed. Her voice lacks the clipped cruelty. Her smile… unsure. He almost doesn’t recognize her.

“I—uh—thought Maris called me,” he says, clearing his throat.

Millie tilts her head. “She’s out. But you can come in. If you want.”

The house is cavernous. Silent. The kind of silence only money can afford — padded, architectural, oppressive.

Millie leads him into a study that reeks of cedar and gin. She gestures to the couch.

“I’ve been thinking,” she starts, sitting too close. “You’ve been through a lot lately.”

He says nothing.

“You’re always so... composed. It must be hard. Pretending everything’s fine.” She touches his arm, her fingers trembling like they’re rehearsing someone else’s move.

Ted tenses.

Millie inches closer.

“You deserve someone who sees you. Really sees you. Someone who wouldn’t play games.”

Her hand rests on his thigh.

“I see you for you, Ted.”

She’s mimicking Maris now — the cadence, the affect — but badly. It’s the Dollar Store version of seduction. The smile falters halfway. Her lip quivers. There’s desperation in the way she leans in. He’s never seen a beautiful girl look so... ugly.

Ted stares at her, expressionless.

“Millie,” he says flatly. “What are you doing?”

She lets out a soft, nervous laugh. “I thought maybe you wanted—”

“I don’t.”

Silence.

“I thought you liked me.”

“I liked that you weren’t her. Until now.”

That lands like a slap.

She sits back, eyes glassing over. “You think I’m pathetic.”

“No,” he lies. “I think you’re confused.”

Her face twitches. She looks down at her lap, where her hands twist in the fabric of her slip. When she looks back up, there’s something broken behind her eyes — a waver of self-awareness that calcifies into bitterness.

“She’s going to ruin you,” she whispers.

Ted doesn’t respond.

“She ruins everyone eventually. Just ask my mother. Or Hunter. Or the maids. Or Stephen.”

He stands. Adjusts his cuffs. His jaw is tense.

“You should go,” she says, before he can.

He’s already at the door. Her voice follows him down the hall — thinner now, shrill with humiliation.

“She laughed when she saw your picture, you know! Said you looked like a drowned rat with buck teeth!”

He closes the door behind him.

Hard.

---

MARIS CALDWELL – AFTERMATH

First Person – Maris’s POV Ten Minutes Later

I find her curled up on the carpet, sobbing into her knees like a jilted debutante. The hem of her slip has ridden up her thighs. Her hair’s limp. Her dignity’s gone.

“Millie,” I say lightly, “what did we learn?”

She doesn’t answer.

I crouch beside her, petting her head like a dying bird.

“Never reach above your station.”

She swats my hand.

I smile.

“She didn’t want him,” Millie hisses. “You didn’t even want him.”

“Oh, darling,” I murmur, leaning in so close she can smell the Marvis on my breath, “that’s why he wanted me. You’re too pathetic. You’d hand your cunt over to a shoe-shiner if he told you you were beautiful.”

Millie’s sob becomes a scream, muffled by shame.

I straighten, glancing in the mirror as I pass — one twin smudged, the other spotless.

Balance, briefly restored.

But not for long.

Ted’s next crack is coming.

And I have Polaroids to prepare.

SCENE: LIZZY LUND — CRISIS CENTRE — JULY 1974 First-person – Ted Bundy’s POV

---

The shift is dragging.

I’ve already fielded two drunks, one neurotic housewife threatening to overdose on sleeping pills because her dentist husband left her for a hygienist named Tammy, and a guy who just wanted someone to talk to while he reloaded his gun. None of it bothers me. None of it ever really has.

Wha

She’s in the corner. Hair tied back with a velvet ribbon. Skirt a little longer today, but the buttons on her blouse still strain, still invite. She’s highlighting phone numbers on a contact sheet like it’s calculus. Chewing the end of her Montblanc like it’s a cigarette.

I can feel her smirking without looking. Like she knows I can’t stop watching. Like she knows I haven't come since her.

Then the red light flickers. Line three. The switchboard buzzes.

Melinda — or Melissa, whatever her real name is — leans over and taps my desk. “Ted? Line three’s asking for you specifically. Said you’d know who it was.”

My throat goes dry. “Did they give a name?”

She shrugs. “Said it was your mother.”

Cold. Everything goes cold. I feel it in the space between my ribs. Like a vacuum just opened inside me.

I pick up the receiver slowly. The coil of the cord wraps too tight.

“…Hello?”

Silence. Then—

“Teddy?”

My fingers freeze on the receiver.

That voice. Soft. Sweet. Like lullabies and linen curtains. Like the smell of Woolworth’s lipstick and Chanel knockoffs.

“I just wanted to hear your voice. I’ve missed you.”

The pulse in my neck kicks like a gunshot.

“Who is this?”

A gentle laugh. “Now don’t be cross with me, Teddy. I know I made some mistakes. But I did the best I could. The Lizzy Lund Home… it wasn’t my fault. I was scared. We both were. But you turned out just fine, didn’t you?”

My jaw clenches. The name hits me like vomit in the throat.

“I’m hanging up.”

“Don’t you dare,” she tuts. “That temper of yours… just like your grandfather’s. Samuel always said—”

Click.

I slam the phone down, hard enough to crack the casing. My vision swims.

Behind me, Maris doesn’t look up from her notes. She just taps her pencil once against the pad, then flips the page. Like she didn’t hear. Like nothing happened.

I reach for my water glass and knock it over.

The water soaks my notepad.

“Everything alright?” Stephen chirps from across the room. He’s wearing my shirt. The one I left in the volunteer cubby.

I don’t answer.

Because I know now.

She’s not done. She’s just getting started.

And the next call won’t come through the switchboard.

It’ll come through her smile.





SCENE: AFTER THE CALL – TED'S ROOM – NIGHT First-person – Ted Bundy

---

I rip the receiver out of the wall.

The click doesn’t come fast enough. Her voice lingers in the air like cigarette smoke.

Lizzy Lund.

Teddy.

Grandfather.

I can’t breathe. The room is too small. The lightbulb above me buzzes, taunting. I lurch forward, knock over the desk lamp, send a pile of papers scattering like ash.

My hands tremble.

I need something to hold. Something real.

The shoe box in the closet. Bottom shelf. I dig through old socks, license stubs, matchbooks, stale weed.

Then I find it.

A photo. Black and white. Eleanor and me. I must’ve been two. I’m clutching a teddy bear. She’s wearing a church dress.

She looks… happy.

No, trying to look happy. There’s something pinched around the mouth. Something dead behind the eyes.

She wasn’t like the other mothers. She was scared of me. Even then.

The teddy bear’s head is missing. I remember that. I tore it off. Bit it until the stuffing came out.

The pastor said I needed Jesus. The neighbour said I needed to be neutered.

I crumple the photo. Then smooth it again. Then shove it back in the box.

A knock.

Not the door.

The window.

There’s nothing outside. But the knock came from inside my head.

---

SCENE: NEXT DAY – MAIL ARRIVAL – TED’S POV

The mail slot clinks. I don’t check it. Not right away. I refuse to give her control.

Not until I see the corner of something white and square. Polaroid.

I already know.

I open the door, slow. Reach down.

My chest seizes.

Stephen.

It’s Stephen.

Laid back on a leather chaise. Legs spread. Shirt unbuttoned. Maris on top of him, straddling, tongue at his neck. His eyes roll back. A single drop of sweat on her clavicle.

The photo's annotated.

"He moaned."

I flip it. On the back:

“Even your replacement is better in bed. xM”

My vision tunnels.

Stephen. Wearing my shirt. Wearing her. My smile. My body language.

That smirking little piece of shit is becoming me.

I tear the photo in half. Then again. And again. And again. My fingers bleed from the edges.

I grab a steak knife from the drawer. Slam it into my mattress. Again. And again. And again.

The stuffing explodes out like guts.

I scream.

No words. Just rage.

---


SCENE: THE HITCHHIKER

July 1974 – Interstate 5 – First Person – Ted Bundy’s POV

It’s nearly midnight.

I haven’t slept. Haven’t eaten. I’ve tried to jerk off twice and couldn’t finish. The sound of her voice — that mother voice — still rings in my ears. Lizzy Lund. Lizzy fucking Lund.

I’m not a child. I’m not a mistake. I’m not some fucking bastard left in a cradle.

I’m not.

The car hums under me like an animal. I’m somewhere past Olympia, the woods dense and the road empty. The streetlights are patchy this far south. No police. No eyes. Just the black, sucking space.

Then I see her.

Thumb out. Denim jacket. Long legs in cut-offs. Blonde, maybe twenty — maybe younger. No bag. No fear.

I slow down.

She flashes a peace sign as she jogs to the door.

“What’s your name?” I ask, keeping the smile neutral.

“Sandy,” she says. “You?”

“John.”

She doesn’t question it. Of course she doesn’t. They never do.

“Where you headed?” I ask.

She shrugs. “Anywhere but here.”

Of course.

We drive for seven minutes before she starts talking. Her ex-boyfriend was a drummer. Her mother’s in a cult. She’s into horoscopes. She likes men who read. I keep nodding, keep pretending to listen.

She’s chewing gum. Loud. Like she doesn’t know what she’s sitting next to.

My knuckles turn white on the wheel.

She says something about how it’s “hard to trust men these days.” How she carries a pocketknife. How she took karate once.

I laugh.

That’s what sets her off. That I laugh.

She stiffens. “What’s funny?”

“You are,” I say, still smiling. “You think you matter.”

I pull off the road so fast her body slams into the door.

“Wait—hey, what are you—”

Her voice is gone the second I backhand her. Her head snaps against the window. She screams once, but there’s no one out here. I yank her from the car by her hair and drag her into the trees.

She claws at me. Her pocketknife is out — but I know where the blade is. I let her slice me once, just to feel it. It doesn’t even sting. I grab her wrist and twist until I hear it pop. The knife falls.

She tries to run. She doesn’t get far.

I throw her to the ground and straddle her back, pressing her face into the dirt. Her legs kick. Her spine bucks.

“You think your mother ever wanted you?” I whisper. “Think she didn’t pray every night for you to die in the womb?”

I clamp both hands around her neck and squeeze.

She pisses herself in the leaves. Her breathing stutters.

When her limbs stop moving, I flip her over and stare at her face. Still. Eyes wide. Mouth open.

She looks like she died surprised.

I leave her just off the shoulder. No need to dig. No need to pose.

She was nothing.

But I feel better.

For now.

---

SCENE: THE MOUTH OF GOD

July 1974 – Caldwell Greenhouse – First Person – Maris Caldwell’s POV

I don’t kill him.

That’s the beauty of it.

I could. I’m wearing gloves. The duct tape is ready. The door is locked. The tools are arranged like they always are: symmetrical, gleaming, hungry.

But I don’t.

Because death is too easy.

He’s a theology student. Mormon. Bright-eyed. Stupid. I met him during one of Henry’s “religious outreach” charity events — something about tithes and the Lord’s good work. He asked if I’d like to join a reading group. Said I seemed “pure.”

That’s what did it.

The word pure.

I invited him for tea.

He brought pamphlets. A Bible. Cookies from his mother.

I brought ketamine.

He’s gagged now. Barely conscious. His wrists tremble where I’ve tied them to the iron crossbeam. His fingers twitch — possibly from blood loss, possibly from fear.

I hold up the surgical scissors. He sees them. He tries to speak. I let him.

“Please—don’t—God’s watching—”

I tilt my head.

“God’s watching?” I echo.

He nods furiously. He’s crying now. The mucus glistens like icing on a failed wedding cake.

I lean close. “Then I guess I’ll have to give Him something to look at.”

He screams when I cut the first corner of his mouth. It’s shallow — artistic, not fatal. A Chelsea smile. Blood drips like theatre makeup. The second cut makes him retch. I hold his head steady with one hand, like a child refusing to eat.

“You’re lucky,” I whisper. “You’ll get to speak. You’ll get to warn people.”

I cut his tongue.

Not all of it. Just enough. A tip. A taste.

He howls.

I tape gauze around the wound. Cauterise it with a heated scalpel. He faints. Comes to. Faints again.

I tuck a Bible into his arms and a Polaroid into his pocket.

The photo is of him smiling. Earlier, before the pain. Before he knew.

On the back, in Sharpie: “She looked like an angel.”

I leave him in a ditch near campus. Half-conscious. Mutilated.

Not dead.

Not yet.

But definitely converted.


SCENE: SUNDAY – ELEANOR’S HOUSE – FIRST-PERSON – TED BUNDY

She’s waiting on the porch with that damn smile. Mom.

I try to calm my breath. Hands in my coat pockets. Nails dug into the lining.

She pours tea. She always pours tea.

“Teddy, honey… I’ve been meaning to tell you. I met the most wonderful young woman at church last Sunday. So polite. So well-spoken. Gorgeous hair. Said her family’s from Bellevue. Maris, I think her name was…”

The room spins.

“What?”

“She even said she knew you. Isn’t that lovely? Imagine that — such a small world.”

I knock the cup over. It shatters.

Eleanor jumps. “Teddy!”

My jaw is locked.

I can still hear the click of the crisis centre phone. Still see Stephen’s smirk. Still hear her say that fucking name like it means nothing.

Maris.

She’s in my church. In my mother’s ear. In my bloodline. While Liz is refusing to see me because of her.

I am not in control anymore. She thinks she is.


SCENE: CHINA TEACUP, CROOKED SMILE — MARIS’S POV First-person – present tense

---

I told her to wear the lilac cardigan. Eleanor.

She asked why, and I said the colour brought out the blue in her eyes. It didn’t, of course — it made her look washed out and feeble, like a leftover Easter bonnet. But she beamed and buttoned it right to the throat.

She made me tea in a cracked Wedgwood cup with fading gilding. The handle was hot. The way she sat across from me — shoulders square, proud of her manners — was so brittle it was almost art.

I asked how old she was when she had him. She didn’t answer right away. Her hands trembled. She muttered something about shame and hospitals and Burlington winters.

I watched her flinch when I said “Lizzy Lund.” That was enough. I didn’t push. I just smiled. Asked what church she attended.

That Sunday, I wore white. Modest. Not a single strand of hair out of place. I sang louder than the congregation and bowed my head deeper than the altar boys. Eleanor sat beside me, radiant. She introduced me to her friends. I think one of them tried to set me up with her nephew.

I said I had a suitor. I didn’t say he was her son.

I left early. A single rose in her pew. A note tucked into her Bible.

"A son’s love is a mirror to the mother. Sometimes it shatters."

That afternoon, I sat in the Lincoln across the street from her porch and watched Ted arrive.

He walked like he had glass in his shoes.

He kissed her cheek. Sat stiffly. Drank the tea.

When she said my name, he froze. His hand jerked and the cup shattered like it was rigged. Porcelain across the floor. Tea on the rug. Eleanor’s hand to her chest like she was about to faint.

He stood. Eyes wide. Breathing like he’d been punched.

I couldn’t hear what he said. I didn’t need to.

I watched him walk down the steps, hands shaking, pupils wide like someone had fed him

I lit a cigarette with my left hand and blew the smoke through the cracked window.

That’s it, Teddy. Now you know what it feels like. To have a mother who never really saw you. To be haunted by your own origin story. To look up at a woman and realise she knows exactly what you are — and isn’t afraid.

He turns suddenly.

Looks straight at the Lincoln.

Doesn’t see me.

But I see him.

His fists are clenched. His lips white.

And for the first time, he doesn’t look hungry.

He looks hunted.


SCENE: THE SECOND CHOICE – FLASHBACK – MILLIE’S POV First-person – late 1972, age 16

---

I’d worn the red slip she gave me.

It wasn’t mine. It wasn’t meant for me. But she said I could borrow it — just for tonight. She even did my makeup. Lined my eyes in kohl, brushed powder across my cheeks until I didn’t look like me anymore.

“Soft lips, Millie,” she whispered. “Men like softness. You’re too stiff all the time.”

I didn’t ask why she was helping me. I just liked the attention.

Hunter was already waiting downstairs. Slouched in the leather armchair by the fire, fiddling with a Zippo lighter like he couldn’t decide whether to smoke or set the rug ablaze.

Maris floated in first. Her hair was pinned high, her collarbones gleaming. She wore nothing under her dress. I knew, because I’d seen her slip it off earlier, unbothered by my presence. She never minded being naked around me. Said we were the same.

But we weren’t.

“You two have fun,” she said, sweeping toward the kitchen. “I need to make a call.”

Hunter looked up at me — not like I was beautiful, but like I was available.

“Didn’t know you were coming down,” he said. His voice was silk dragged over gravel. “You look… older.”

“Thanks,” I mumbled, twisting the hem of the slip.

He stood. Stepped closer. I backed up instinctively until my legs hit the couch.

He smelled like expensive bourbon and a hunger I didn’t know how to name.

“She said you’d be better this time,” he murmured.

“What?”

“Less nervous.”

He pressed me back. His hand slid to the inside of my thigh.

The slip rode up. My breath hitched.

“She said it was okay?” I asked.

“She offered you.”

---

I didn’t cry that time.

Not out loud. Not where he could hear.

I kept my eyes fixed on the ceiling. Counted the tiny hairline cracks like stars.

Afterward, I found Maris in her room, painting her toenails.

She looked up. Smiled.

“Well?”

“I did what you said.”

“Good girl.”

She kissed my forehead like a mother might. Then went back to her toes.

---

SCENE: LATER – 1974 – PRESENT DAY – CRISIS CENTRE Maris’s POV – reflection

Stephen’s talking about morality again. Something about Kant. He’s getting the phrasing wrong, but I don’t correct him.

He offers me a bite of his sandwich. Turkey and tomato on Wonder Bread. I take it. The crusts are still on. He doesn’t notice when I toss the bite into the bin while pretending to chew.

He tells me I’m the only one who listens to him. That I “get it.”

He doesn’t know he’s already become something else.

Millie thought if she gave herself up, I’d love her. Stephen thinks if he imitates me, I’ll protect him.

They’re both wrong.

I only love what’s useful. And love, as they understand it, is not useful.


SCENE: THE THIEF IN THE CHAPEL

Maris’s POV – Present tense

---

I don’t notice it at first.

The box is still in the drawer. The velvet still uncreased. The letters from Hunter still stacked like shame under perfume blotters.

But the scarf is gone.

My navy silk Hermès — the one with the ivory horse heads and gold chains. I wore it the morning after the Polaroid. The day I visited Eleanor.

I pause. Check again.

It’s not there.

I don’t misplace things. I don’t lose things. And I don’t leave them behind — especially not silk.

I dress slower than usual. Choose a tailored ivory blouse. No scarf. The absence makes my neck feel naked.

I go about the day. Eat toast I don’t want. Read the news for murders that aren’t mine. Watch Stephen laugh at something Ted said — a low, practiced imitation of the real thing.

Then, while passing the chapel vestibule on campus, something glints in the corner of my eye.

A stained-glass alcove. Unused. Forgotten. Lit by soft filtered light.

And there — Folded.

Placed like an offering at the feet of the Virgin Mary.

My scarf.

Tied in a delicate knot.

Underneath it: a clipping from the Seattle Times obituary column. Not of a victim. Of a priest.

Father Jonathan Lowe. Died of a heart attack. Beloved. Kind.

I kneel. Slowly. Fingers precise. Untie the knot.

Tucked inside the folds: a scrap of notebook paper. Torn edges. Pencil.

“God doesn’t forgive what you are.”

No signature.

Just that. He’s been in here. Ted.


SCENE: THE RETALIATION — TED’S POV

First-person – Present tense – Late July 1974 Setting: Ted’s apartment, night. The hitchhiker’s murder hasn’t satisfied him. Maris is still in his blood.

---

The first thing I notice is the silence. No running water. No wind. No sound at all.

I sit on the edge of the mattress, staring at the Polaroid in my hand. Not one of Maris. Not this time.

This one’s different.

The kid’s maybe eight. Nine. Liz’s daughter. I snapped it last week while they were at Green Lake. She was licking an ice cream cone. Wearing a blue jumper. One pigtail crooked. Nothing sexual. Nothing obscene.

But the message is clear.

I could.

My hands are steady. I write slowly, neatly, on the back.

This one’s never even kissed a boy. What would you do with her?

I pause.

Then underline “you.”

She started this. She thinks she knows me. That I’m predictable. That I’m beneath her.

But this — this is something she can’t laugh off.

She’ll think I’m sick. She’ll be right.

But she’ll also know I’m watching. That I’m not afraid of her. That I can be just as cruel.

I tuck the photo into a lavender envelope. The exact shade of her stationery. I know where she parks on Tuesdays.

SCENE: THE ENVELOPE — MARIS’S POV

First-person – Present tense – Following morning Setting: University parking lot

---

I spot it before I even reach the car. Lavender. Cream handwriting. Tucked beneath the wiper blade like a love letter.

I glance around. No one watching. But that’s never mattered, has it?

I slide it free. Open it with one manicured finger. A Polaroid.

Liz’s daughter.

Ice cream. Pigtails. Big brown eyes squinting in the sun. Unremarkable messy child.

I flip it over.

This one’s never even kissed a boy. What would you do with her?

I read it twice. Three times. The handwriting is his. The need is his. Tries to use cursive, fails. Tries to abduct the women he covets, decides a child is less resistance. Thinks sane people see children the way he does. Thinks this is psychological warfare.

I don’t react.

Instead, I tuck the photo into my bag. I will not destroy it. That would give it power.

No — I’ll keep it. Just like I kept the scarf he tried to return through prayer. Just like I kept the picture of his mother’s hospital record. Just like I’ll keep the knife I plan to use when this is all over.

This isn’t a threat. It’s a confession.

And he doesn’t even know it yet.



CENE: THE PROTECTOR

Liz Kendall’s POV — First-person Summer 1974

---

I don’t know why I opened the mailbox.

He usually does it. Says it’s too far from the apartment door. That I shouldn’t “walk around alone like that.” But today he was late. Again.

Inside the mailbox was an envelope. My name on it. Not his handwriting.

Inside: a photo.

Me.

Taken from behind — at the kitchen sink, bent slightly, wearing the blue robe I thought was flattering. I remember that morning. I was making cocoa.

He hadn’t said a word.

Taped to the back of the photo: a note. Typed. No signature.

“She’s watching him. And he’s watching you.”

I nearly dropped it.

But I couldn’t bring myself to tell him. Not at first.

That night, he came home with flowers. No occasion. Just daisies — the kind you get when you don’t know someone well enough to pick anything else.

He kissed my temple like I was made of glass.

“Have you been okay?” he asked, all concern. “You’ve seemed… tense lately.”

I hesitated. Then I showed him the photo.

He studied it for a moment. His face changed. Not anger — something colder. Calculated.

“I think I know who sent this.”

He said it slowly, like he was weighing each word.

“She’s dangerous, Liz.”

“Who?”

“Her name’s Maris. She’s from campus and the hotline. Pretty. Too pretty. Too used to getting what she wants. She came on to me, Liz. I told her no. But she’s… unstable.”

My stomach turned.

He touched my cheek. “I didn’t want to scare you. That’s why I didn’t say anything sooner. But I think she’s following me.”

“But why me?”

He pulled me close. Pressed his lips to my hair.

“Because you have what she doesn’t. A soul.”

---

SCENE: CUT TO MARIS – LATER THAT NIGHT – HER POV

I watch Liz through the diner window.

She’s holding the flowers too tight. Nervous. Her lipstick’s uneven. The anxiety makes her forget how to smile.

Ted’s inside, across from her. Gesturing with his hands like he’s telling a sad story. Like he’s the victim. He’s always the victim.

I sip my coffee from across the street.

Of course he lied.

But it won’t save him.

Because now Liz is primed. All it takes is one more crack… and she’ll see the truth.


SCENE: PORCELAIN TEETH

Maris and Louise Bundy – Private Tea – Bundy Home – Maris’s POV

---

The china is blue willow, this time. The kind that’s meant to be heirloomed, not touched in homes of the middle class. It’s a strange way to live – to prefer to look at items instead of using them for their intended purposes. Mrs Bundy sets the teacups down with a grace that almost makes me forget who she raised. If Quinn’s given me something, it’s my etiquette and ease with the elderly.

“I’m so glad you could come, dear.”

“Thank you for inviting me again, I so enjoyed your company last week, Mrs Bundy.” I fold my hands just so in my lap. A doll at Sunday school. Rehearsed smile. Lilt in the voice for respect.

The kitchen is spotless. No sign of Ted anywhere. Just the soft clink of spoon against porcelain and the faint smell of starch and lemon polish.

“You remind me of Diane,” she says suddenly.

I smile. Tilt my head. “Ted’s ex-girlfriend?”

She waves her hand. “Oh, he was never really over her. But you — you’re firmer. In a good way.” She laughs. “Less… needy. That girl was always crying about something.”

I sip. “Men do like self-control.”

She leans in, conspiratorial now. “Did you know, when he was little, he used to lie about the silliest things? He once told me he built a rocket. Hadn’t even touched a wrench.” She chuckles. “He’d look you straight in the eye and spin a story without blinking.”

“Sounds practiced,” I say, laughing politely.

Louise nods. “He always was a performer. God help the woman who believes everything he says.”

I let the silence bloom. Let it settle into her teacup.

Then I smile. “It’s lucky we met, then.”

SCENE: THE LEFTOVERS

Liz Kendall – Later That Evening – Alone – Liz’s POV

---

The casserole’s gone cold. She left it in the car. She doesn’t care.

She replays the moment over and over — Louise’s tone, the way she leaned into Maris like they were already family.

“She reminds me of Diane.”

Not me.

Never me.

The photo albums in the hallway don’t feature her. The Sunday roasts don’t include her name. And now, the one person she thought would always be on her side — Louise — is quoting piano concertos and laughing like Maris is her long-lost niece.

She pours wine. Too much. Sloshes over the edge.

What if he leaves her? What if he already has?

She finds herself dialing his number. It rings once. Twice. Then: voicemail.

She hangs up. Calls again.

This time, she leaves a message.

“Ted, I—I don’t know what you’re doing or where you are, but I hope you know… she’s not who you think she is.”

She pauses. Her voice drops.

“She’s not me.”

SCENE: THE HOUSE ON THE HILL

Caldwell Estate – One Week Later – Ted’s POV

---

It’s easier than I expected.

All it took was a blazer, a clipboard, and a Republican voter registration badge. Bellevue’s full of rich men who like other rich men.

The Caldwell maid lets me in without a second glance. “You’re here for the polling data?”

I nod. Smile. “Just a few quick questions for Miss Caldwell. Shouldn’t take long.”

The walls are too quiet. The air too still. I’ve been here before, but somehow it feels… wrong when I’m not escorted by her, when I’m forced to evaluate the opulence in

silence. It reminds me how much I don’t belong here. When I’m with her, sure, I still feel it. But she has this way of convincing people they matter, that they’re on her level. Until she’s done toying with them and throws them back into the street, or Lake Sammamish for garbage collection.

I pass a music room. A greenhouse.

Something rustles in the vents.

I find her in the sunroom, lounging on a chaise in a man’s shirt. It sets my teeth on edge. I feel like I’ve been hollowed, punched in the gut.

She looks up. Doesn’t flinch. “You made it.”

I blink. “You knew?”

“I saw you on the lawn.” She crinkles her nose. “I told Mother the staff are incompetent.”

She pours herself a drink. Doesn’t offer me one.

“Did you know your mother and I are planning a fundraiser?” she says sweetly. “She wants me to chair the floral arrangements.”

I clench my jaw. She stands, moving across the Oriental rug barefoot toward me.

“You know what I think?” She steps closer. “I think your mother wishes I was her daughter.”

Then she leans in. There’s a twitch on one side of her mouth.

“And maybe, just maybe, she deserves better than a son like you,” she says, right in my face. Her eyes are cold despite the smile. “I’ll have Rosa show you out.”


SCENE: THE SPARE TWIN

Caldwell Estate – Evening – Maris’s POV

---

I find her in the reading room. Knees curled up on the settee like she’s sixteen again.

She startles when I walk in — as if I haven’t been watching her for ten minutes through the glass door.

“I didn’t touch anything,” she says quickly.

“That’s never the problem, Millie.”

I walk over, pick up the ashtray, tilt the contents out the window like I own the air outside. She’s been smoking those menthol slims she thinks make her look French.

She tries to read my face. Fails.

Then she blurts, “I saw him.”

I stop.

“Saw who?”

“Ted.” She’s sitting up now, anxious, wringing her hands. “He came by yesterday. I didn’t let him in, I swear—well, he didn’t ask to come in. He just… stood there. Said he wanted to talk.”

I stare.

“He looked sad.” Her voice is soft, hopeful. “Said he was sorry for how things ended with you. That he never meant to hurt you. That you—”

“Stop.”

“I just thought maybe—maybe he’s not—”

I move so fast the glass clinks from the shift in air. My hand slams the wall beside her head. Not touching. But close enough.

“Do you know what you just did?” I hiss. “Do you have any idea what you’re risking?”

She blinks at me. Teary. “I didn’t—”

“You never do. You never think.”

I grab the throw from her lap and rip it away. She’s lucky it’s not her throat I’m lunging for
