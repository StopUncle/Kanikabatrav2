THE RECIPE FOR DIALOGUE SCENES
Structure for Each Scene:
SETTING + CONTEXT
Brief description of location and what's happening
Who is present
INNER VOICE (The Subtle Hint)
NOT explicit instruction ("frame flip")
Describes the feeling, dynamic, or observation ("Notice how she's doing it")
Tells the user what's happening, not what to do
Should make the principle recognizable in hindsight
NPC DIALOGUE (The Setup)
NPC says/does something that creates a test or challenge
Contains the "trap" that players can fall into
Reveals the NPC's strategy (triangulation, status-testing, etc.)
FOUR CHOICE OPTIONS (Trap, Subtle, Close, Optimal)
TRAP: Longest or most emotionally reactive. Falls into the NPC's frame.
SUBTLE: Safe but passive. Misses leverage.
CLOSE: Good strategy but reveals too much interest/effort.
OPTIMAL: Shortest or most efficient. Redirects the dynamic. Teaches the principle through consequence.
RESULT NARRATION
Explains what happened and why
Shows the consequence (Control Score change)
Reveals the principle the user just learned
Length Guidelines:
TRAP/SUBTLE: Can be shorter initially, but should match CLOSE/OPTIMAL length in harder scenes
CLOSE: Medium length, shows strategic thinking but incomplete
OPTIMAL: Varies—sometimes shortest, sometimes medium. Never the longest.
Inner Voice Formula:
Describe the dynamic or feeling, not the tactic
Use observation language: "Notice...", "He's testing...", "She's trying..."
Leave the solution for the player to discover in the dialogue choices
EXAMPLE APPLIED:
Easy Scene (Scene 1):
Inner Voice: "He's impressed by status. Show him you're not impressed by him—be self-sufficient."
(More direct, teaches the principle clearly)
Hard Scene (Scene 4):
Inner Voice: "She's trying to make you feel like you're competing. Notice how she's doing it."
(Subtle, describes the dynamic, player has to recognize the counter-move)
Ready for the next instruction. What do you want me to do with this?
