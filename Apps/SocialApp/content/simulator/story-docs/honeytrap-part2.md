I’m perched in a low hanging tree cove, my legs dangling and the dart gun in my lap. Millie is across from me, on the other side of the semi‑forest, invisible to the untrained eye. She’s got a sturdy white rope with her—it’s usually used to dock Father’s yacht. I’m in the leotard I wore under my dress, which lies folded neatly in the trunk of the car. I see him stumble and fall out of the car, with blood gushing from his head. He crawls around for a little while, endeavoring to gather himself. I think he’s crying, but my vision is a little obstructed from the dark, and I can’t see all that clearly. When he manages to get to his feet he stumbles and sways, grabbing his head with one hand. He breaks into a clumsy run, limbs moving awkwardly. He manages to gain a little speed. I shoot him in the leg, and he tumbles down, screaming in pain.
“I like that you’re trying,” I call to him, laughing. Millie lets out a little panicked giggle too.
“Wh‑why are you doing this?” he asks me, clutching his leg and sobbing.
“We all need to have a little fun sometimes, James.” I shoot him in the arm. At this point, ketamine will be flooding his veins. He’ll get respite from the pain and if he’s lucky, he may slip into a k‑hole and start thinking this is all a hallucination. He lies quite still and then shudders repeatedly. He manages to make it back to his feet, and he starts running again, this time toward Millie. He seems to have a fair amount of fight in him and it’s wonderfully entertaining. I shoot him in the back. He falls over.
“Keep trying, please,” says Millie, laughing harder now. I’m not sure if the thrill has made her giddy or if she’s refraining from crying. Millie often laughs when she’s suppressing tears. He staggers toward her, uncomprehendingly noticing that she’s there. I think it’s only now dawning on him that there are two of us. I don’t even find it strange. I did, after all, go out of my way to make sure there were no visible differences. I give him a minute to realize he’s not getting out of here and then shoot him in the chest. I hop down from the tree and walk to him. He’s fallen again, but this time he’s unconscious. I can’t imagine it’s been more than twenty minutes.

“Millie, come help me,” I yell, grabbing his limp arms. I drag him into the brush, with her help once she finally manages to get to us. I left a butcher’s knife around here when I dropped by earlier today. I want him to wake up, and I wait. I feel cheated, I’ve worked so hard and I’m out of breath. The look of sheer, unbridled terror and despair is one that is unparalleled. It quells the restlessness, the boredom, the lack of directed energy. It gives you power. You’re in the position to decide whether or not the person beneath you gets another breath. It’s like being god, and that’s all I’ve ever wanted to be. If the person is unconscious, you don’t feel their fear. You don’t hear their desperate sobs and pleas for mercy, about how they want to see their families and their poor darn girlfriends and pets one last time. You don’t get to see their reaction once the knife digs in, slicing their skin neatly from ear to ear. I feel rather empty as I slit his throat. He bleeds profusely and convulses, coughing up phlegm and blood. I push the knife deeper along his jugular, twisting it several times. He’s conscious now but not to the point where he can speak or react, especially not with his windpipe carved open. He continues spurting blood from his mouth and nose and chokes on it a couple of times. His eyes don’t open. It’s so pathetic, I feel so pathetic. It’s like killing a toddler. He puts up little effort against me when I stab him again. He keels to the side, and I shine the flashlight on his face. It’s stained with blood and sweat, mingled with tears, and his hair is deeply matted. I kick him in the gut, hard. I need him to wake up. He squirms and lets out little yelps of pain, but he’s not all there. His cries get weaker with every kick.
“Do you want to do anything to him?” I ask Millie. I offer her the knife.
She takes it from me and jabs him meekly. If I weren’t upset, I’d almost feel sorry for the poor boy. I try to awaken him, kicking again and again. When he doesn’t, I put him out of his misery. The foul odor of excrement wafts toward me, and I know he’s dead. The stillness associated with the freshly dead sets in, and I wash my hands and legs in the stream of water. The body won’t be seen for a while. Even Millie had trouble finding the location.
H o ne y traT R A p
51
I wait for her to wash up, and she does so painfully slowly. I wash off the knife and leave it in the brush. I take off the leotard and put the dress back on.
We have our father’s hotel opening to attend. He’s on very good terms with most of the media, and I picked my outfit for the occasion. I make Millie change into a Dior jumpsuit. It’s a very generous concession—it cost about double what my outfit did, and it has beautiful flared ends and a low‑cut neckline, while mine is positively puritanical. She’s earned herself a little treat. I toss her matching blue dress out the window of the car. I let her drive, I’m exhausted. My arms are throbbing, and my cold has worsened.
“Are we driving straight there?” asks Millie. She looks to me as I light a cigarette.
“Well, obviously. It’s almost midnight. We were meant to be there about four hours ago. We don’t exactly have time for a casual pit stop at home.”
“Jeez, alright, I was just making sure.” Her hands are trembling on the steering wheel. She always gets a little emotional. I’m hoping soon I can work alone.
When we arrive, we’re greeted by an eager valet, a barrage of photographers, and elegantly dressed couples spilling out onto the street. Millie hands over the keys, and we pose for a few photos together. Hunter is standing outside, by one of the columns, smoking. He sees me and rushes over, draping himself around me. I kiss him for the cameras, hold his hand, and lead him inside. I note Father first, dressed crisply in a Valentino tuxedo, his dark hair combed back the way Mother likes.
“Daddy, it’s lovely to see you,” I tell him, still keeping Hunter’s hand in mine as I hug him.
“Maris, you look beautiful. You look fantastic, too, Hunter. Thank your parents for coming for me, will you?”
Hunter laughs out of politeness (mostly, but I can smell alcohol on his breath too) and nods. “Of course, Mr. Caldwell, you know I will.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
52
“It’s Henry, you can call me Henry.” I suppress a smile. He’d never let me hear the end of it if Hunter were to actually take him up on his bluff offer.
“We’re going to get a drink, enjoy your night, Daddy.”
Mother is on the horizon, her floor‑length gown unmissable. She’s heading for Father, and I make a hasty escape.
“Where were you? I’ve been waiting for well over an hour,” Hunter tells me as we walk through the lobby, greeting people along the way.
“I’m preparing early for college, doing my readings. It’s only a couple of weeks until we go back.”
“You’re already studying? Jesus Christ, Maris, you need to chill.”
“Why don’t you fuck me in the bathroom, that’ll probably help me chill,” I say, “Oh, and maybe a glass of champagne?” I kiss his neck, briefly. The conservatives are hovering.
“What, here? It’s your parents’ opening party.”
I kiss him on the lips this time, slow, lingering. “Well, when you put it that way, maybe I should stick to the champagne. Fuck you.” I start to walk away. I don’t have time for his bullshit—there are plenty of other guys around tonight. He tries to pull me back, grabbing my arm, but I shake him off. I’m more delighted than I should be upon seeing Jack.
“Oh my lord, I’m so happy you’re here,” I say, hugging him tightly. “You know how to party.”
“Let’s get you some champagne,” he tells me, threading his arm through mine. It’s strange how he hasn’t mentioned Carol. He cried about her for a full hour on the telephone earlier in the evening.
“That’s exactly what I wanted to hear, Jack, you understand me.”
He looks particularly pretty. He’s had his blonde hair trimmed, and his suit emphasizes his swimmers’ shoulders and snug little waist. He flags down a waiter and hands me a flute. I take a demure sip, but all I want to do is down the entire glass. He puts his hand on the small of my back, leading me to a seat in
H o ne y traT R A p
53
a secluded alcove. It’s an intimate little spot, away from the din of the party and the loud, outdated jazz music.
“How are you doing, honey?” I ask him, taking another sip and leaning in. I rub his hand.
“I’m alright. I’m trying not to think about it.” He takes a swig. “I feel a hell of a lot of guilt, though Maris. I feel like it’s my fault. I was dating Carol, and you know I’ve always had a thing for you and now I feel rubbish.”
“Why do you feel rubbish? Carol disappearing is not your fault. I’m sure she’ll be found well.”
“I was going to end things. I should’ve been better to her. I shouldn’t have spent our time together talking about you—no offense—but she started to feel real insecure about it.”
“I had no idea, Carol never let on.”
“No, she didn’t want to make you upset. She didn’t know about us.”
“Oh honey, please, this isn’t your fault. Obviously, you and Carol were meant to be together, no matter how much I like you. She really loves you.”
“I was going to dump her and now she’s probably dead. Wouldn’t you feel awful?”
“Look, you need to stop blaming yourself. Firstly, she’s likely fine, and secondly, I wasn’t planning to dump Hunter, and you weren’t planning to dump Carol,” I tell him. I run a hand through his hair.
“As soon as I got here, things started with her and then I met you, and I made her feel so goddamn lousy.”
“Is being this upset going to help anything? We need to be strong right now and stick together until we find her, which we will. Please, she wouldn’t want you to be worried.” I swig the champagne.
“Maris, sweetheart, what are you doing back here?”
I look up to see Mother, her voice a soothing coo (most likely from the alcohol and a Percocet or two). She stands cross‑legged with the bottom of her gown lifted slightly, her tiny frame teetering on six‑inch heels. She disregards Jack, not bothering
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
54
with a hello. She thinks very little of our Californian counterparts, particularly the sun‑drenched blondes with a knack for surfing. She’s a very indoorsy, reserved person. She eyes him critically with a thinly veiled sneer. She’s probably wondering how he found a suit in his wardrobe. “The party is out there, you should be there for interviews with some of the journalists, preferably with Hunter. The Carlyle family is one we should be publicly associating with.” She stares pointedly at Jack.
“Hello, dear—Jack, was it? We do need Maris outside.”
“Yeah, Mrs. Caldwell—Jack. I’ve been around for a couple of years now.” His laugh is awkward and forced.
“Yes, well, as I said, we need our Maris talking to the very interested journalists. This is our first hotel in our home city, and it’s an exciting time for the family.”
“I totally understand. I didn’t mean to keep her from you guys.”
“Mother, don’t you think you’re being a little rude to Jack?”
“Jack, I do apologize if I’m being particularly brusque, it’s just an important night,” she tells him through gritted teeth. I love to make her grovel. She prides herself on her perfect etiquette, often omitting interactions with those she considers her inferiors. I’m not exactly an advocator for the rights of those on the bottom rungs of society, but Jack’s family’s net worth is far from poverty. Their money may be new and founded by sheer dumb luck, while ours has traveled down through several generations on both sides, but my treating him as if he were no better than the common vagrant seems out of order.
“Not at all, Mrs. Caldwell, of course I understand.”
He stands up and brushes non‑existent dirt off his blazer, reaching for my arm. Mother’s eyes zero in on his hand and then meet mine. She raises a manicured eyebrow, and her jaw stiffens. She doesn’t need to articulate her revulsion. I know the look. I release his hand. “Hunter’s been looking for you, dear. Don’t you want to spend some time with him? I’m sure Susannah or that Dawn girl can keep your friend here company.”
H o ne y traT R A p
55
“Jack, come on, I’ll introduce you to some of the journos,” I say for Mother’s benefit. She lets him walk ahead, latching on sharply to my arm with her talons.
“Just what in Christ’s name do you think you’re doing, Maris?” she hisses, digging into my skin. “First, you come in four hours late, and now you’re here doing god knows what with that filthy Californian cast‑off. Have you even thought about how important tonight is for our family? You have Millie out there dressed like a common whore, and you’re wearing what looks to be a sack from Sears. Are you out of your mind? Are you trying to sabotage us?”
“Mother, you’re making a scene. Did you not take your Xanax today? I’m not trying to do anything; I’m talking to a friend. What Millie wears is none of my concern, and quite frankly, I adore this dress. You bought it for me if you’ll recall.”
“I bought it for you when you were fifteen because Millie wanted it, and I didn’t want you to feel left out. It wasn’t meant to be worn by a girl in college. Jesus, Maris.”
“I’m very sorry, I genuinely am,” I tell her, looking her in the eye. “Honestly, Mom, you know I wouldn’t do this on purpose.”
She softens. “It’s alright, I believe you. I just need you to be more responsible, more accountable. You’re not a child anymore, and you know you have obligations as a member of this family.”
“Of course, I understand. You and Daddy did mention the importance of tonight. I wanted to get prepared for classes as early as possible, and as for the dress, I really like it. It’s not from Sears. You know it’s an Ossie Clark, and it’s special because you bought it for me.”
“Oh, Maris, you’re very sweet sometimes. You’re very sweet. I think you get it from your father.”
“I feel awful, I’m really sorry. I’ll speak to some of the journalists to make up for my behavior. It’s rather uncalled‑for, I completely agree with you,” I say, waiting for her grip on my arm to loosen. For such a small woman, she sure is strong, and I think she’s perforating my flesh. “I would love to spend some time with you, Mother. I don’t see you nearly as often as I’d like.”

“We ought to get coffee tomorrow and talk. I know you’re probably more upset about Carol than you’re letting on,” she says. “You’ve always been very…quiet about your issues.”
“I would love that, I would. You and Millie are the only people I feel comfortable talking to and I’ve run myself into a breakdown. I can’t seem to cope.”
“Alright, honey, we can talk tomorrow. I’m sure you’ll be pleased to know that your father will be home for two weeks before he flies to Vienna for that conference.” Her hand relaxes, freeing me. “I need you to talk to The Washington Times for me, dear. I daren’t trust Millie with that, and besides, she usually requires a little prodding from you anyway.”
“Of course, I hope it’s Barth? He’s my favorite from The Times.”
“Yes, he’s here with his wife and daughter. We figured if we invited him as a guest and not a member of the gallery, he might give us a little extra something in his review.”

CHAPTER FIVE
When I return at nearly 5 AM, the body appears to be in the early stages of decomposition, hastened by the dewy summer weather. Alone, I struggle to strip him of his jeans and shirt. He weighs a lot more than I’d imagined, and I yank on the clothes with all my force to lift his lifeless body into a more comfortable position for me. It’s a terrible idea to leave clothes on a body. They trap fibers and hair, soil samples, and bloodstains. If the police had any idea what they were doing, they may be able to trace that information back to you. When the male is naked, I pile his clothes neatly beside him, folding them with the strict corners Rosa accords all our laundered blouses. I take several Polaroid photos of my prey, particularly the savaged bits of his torso and his face, with the eyes still wide open, glassy, and staring. His hair is matted with his blood and possibly some of mine from the struggle—the cut on my hand has yet to heal. I’ve brought my hacksaw with me as well as a butcher’s knife that, once unsheathed, smiles up at me from my bag. I don’t know if there’s much information around on decapitation, but it is possibly one of the most difficult tasks I’ve ever taken upon. It’s really fucking tough. It takes a hell of a lot longer than the movies and documentaries let on. I’m not exactly a bodybuilder, either, so it takes me forty‑five minutes to sever all his fingers at the knuckles alone.
Deaths in movies and detective magazines seem so breezy, almost effortless, but I’m telling you, humans take a very long time to finally give up, and even longer when they know their
58
bodies are about to be cut up. We all have a strong instinct for survival, so we fight until there’s no strength left in us. I’m not a sicko; I don’t enjoy this part of it. I don’t have a morbid fascination with decapitation, nor do I get orgasms thinking about it, but it’s pertinent to ensure that investigators take at least a couple of months to identify the remains. This is achieved in a number of ways.
First and foremost: fingerprints. They are the single most‑used identifier for found corpses and the people who may have caused the deaths. I sever each of his fingers and his toes for good measure. It’s important to not get sloppy. Dealing with knives and hacksaws can cause many injuries too. I seem to have cut myself in many places, but I’m numbed to the pain as I work. My focus is impenetrable with the second object of identification—his skull. It’s the most fun, and of course the most strenuous. I work tirelessly with the saw.
The fleshy parts of his neck slice open smoothly, as do his arteries, but the bone is stubborn and unrelenting. I nearly break my arm in the process of beheading him, but a sweet joy floods me when the last of the cervical vertebrae gives way. I sit and study him while I regain my composure. The face on this cadaver gives me more satisfaction than his face in life—fear in his open eyes, defeat, his mouth. His blonde hair is abundant, both on his head and on his body. I feel a wave of nausea at the sight of his bare chest. The hair is thick enough to serve as carpet for the den. His hands appear rugged, a far cry from the actuality of his sheltered, fledgling academic career. His lips are girlish, more so than Hunter’s, almost as full as mine. His teeth form perfect white rectangles and whatever’s left of his forehead appears clear, lacking pimples and other blemishes. Blood has congealed about his muscular thighs. The stab wounds are still gaping, soon to be infested with maggots. Nature is beautiful; she does most of the cleanup herself.
I’m exhausted and I have yet to go to bed. It takes all my strength to not fall asleep right here. I leave his headless cadaver in a mound of rotting leaves. His head goes into a canvas tote
H o ne y traT R A p
59
lined with a bin wrapper, along with his clothes and the butcher’s knife. I shove more brush onto him, breaking off a weak branch from one of the trees and tossing it onto whatever’s visible. The putrefaction will set in soon, and it’ll start reeking in no time. Summer is wonderful when it comes to that and trips to tropical islands. In winter, particularly a Washingtonian winter, bodies stay preserved, often freezing over. In summer, the flesh rots, and the insects gorge. There’s no good place to hide a hacksaw, so I head back to the car with it in one hand and the overwhelmingly heavy skull in the other.
I dump both in the trunk. My legs feel as if they’ll fold underneath me, and my head is pounding from the champagne and the lack of sleep. My dress is conservative enough to not look too peculiar in the daytime should anyone see me. I stash the Polaroids into a small case of mine. I always flip through them when I’m feeling down. My drive home is quiet. The traffic in the city hasn’t quite commenced. I listen to the talkback radio instead of the music channels. I love talkback radio. I love to listen to people uninhibited in their conversations. I could listen to it for most of the day if I’m being honest.
I drive into the garage, wearily making my way up the stairs into the house. It’s peaceful, without the noise of Mother’s voice, Rosa’s vacuum, Millie’s records, and Father’s mind‑numbing television. I’m thankful they’re all asleep and out of my way.
I head to my room and lock the door. I pull my clothes off, my bra, slip, and underwear, and collapse onto my bed. My aching body doesn’t require Valium’s holy assistance. I huddle myself in the light summer quilt and pass out almost immediately.
I dream vividly of the Seychelles, sunlight glinting on the calm, impossibly turquoise sea, my legs tanned and flecked with sand whiter than I’ve ever seen. Anse Lazio beach encircles me and the water laps at my ankles. I look down and see my coral bikini, the matching sarong clinging wetly to my hips. Hunter is beside me, but he doesn’t speak. His face soon morphs into Jack’s. Carol is on a reclining beach chair behind us, absorbed in a copy of The Second Sex. She’s wearing a bright yellow caftan, with what K anikaANI K A B AT R A
60
I recognize as my large tortoiseshell sunglasses. I call to her, but she doesn’t respond. I try again, but she can’t hear me. Stephen lurks nearby, which I find odd as he’s never left the United States. I attempt to walk to Carol, to grab her arm, but I can’t move. The water feels heavy around me, weighing me down so I’m entirely immobilized. She drifts further from me as I’m drawn into the sea. Jack anchors me and holds my hands as they disintegrate into grains of sand. Carol looks up from her book, glancing in my direction, but I can’t tell whether or not she can see me. Her eyes are obstructed by the glasses and her wide‑brimmed straw hat. A lone tear slips down her cheek, which is now becoming pallid. Blood begins pooling around her neck, dripping into the cotton fabric of the caftan. She removes her sunglasses, placing them in her trembling lap. The water rises around me. Jack is speaking to me in gibberish, his voice muffled and hoarse as if I had gauze in my ears.
Carol is sobbing now as the blood trickles down her chest. “How could you let him do this to me?” Her gaze travels from me to Stephen.
I don’t know what time it is when I wake up—I think I may have knocked my clock down with an errant flip of my arm during my sleep. It’s raining outside, the clouds heavy, and the sky lacking any indication of future sunshine. I roll around in my bed, the sheets tangled comfortably between my limbs and bringing me the warmth I wouldn’t expect to need in the middle of July. I can hear Rosa outside my door, banging the noisy vacuum cleaner against the banisters of the staircase. I reach for my clock once I find the strength to sit up. It’s twenty‑five minutes past two, but I don’t feel any more refreshed than I did when I went to sleep. I find it difficult to function on less than nine to ten hours of sleep, but I struggle to achieve this. I can only sleep five hours at a time, so I generally wake up for an agonizing ten minutes—popping as many benzos as I can—and then try to fall back to sleep. It’s very troubling and inconvenient. I want to go back to sleep, but I know I have a shopping date with a good friend I met in Utah a
H o ne y traT R A p
61
few years ago. Her family travels back and forth between Tacoma and Provo every couple of weeks or so. They have this nasty little Volkswagen campervan, and I don’t really know what any of them do for a living. I stayed with them in their winter house at Crystal Mountain and avoided numerous advances from her acne‑ridden little brother. I quite enjoy Heather’s company. She’s a striking girl, slender and delicate with the lithe, graceful body of a ballet dancer. Her Mormon family isn’t at all aware that she’s a lesbian. Her closet is so deep that it may as well serve as a black hole.
I run a bath, sitting on the edge of the tub as the water fills. I’m not in the mood for a quick shower. I don’t have it in me to rush about now. My hangover is mild, but my lack of sleep takes a great toll. I lower myself into the water, blisteringly hot, and close my eyes. I grab the loofah and squirt a glob of Chanel bodywash onto it, gently running it along my fatigued legs. I savor the quiet, the calm. I pull my hair into a messy bun. My heart slows, and I breathe in the divine honeycomb and vanilla scent of the soap. With a great amount of effort, I peel myself off the marble tub. I put on my terrycloth bathrobe and tie it loosely around my waist. I sift through my clothes, eventually putting on a full‑sleeved, ruby red skintight blouse and a skirt with horizontal red and white stripes. I drape a white cotton sweater around myself, tying the sleeves in a gentle knot above my collarbone. It doesn’t look particularly warm outside, but I hate stockings, so I don’t bother to put any on. I sit on the edge of my bed, cradling the telephone in my lap as I slip on some shoes. I dial her grandmother’s home phone, the only number I have for her in Washington. It rings for a while before her nasal‑sounding mother answers.
“Hello?”
“Oh, hello Mrs. Oldcastle, this is Maris Caldwell. I was wondering if I may speak to Heather?”
“Maris, honey, of course you can. Let me get her for you.” She doesn’t cover the speaker well as she barks loudly for her daughter.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
62
Heather’s soothing voice soon takes over. “Hi Maris, I was about to phone you. Would you like to meet in front of Rhodes’ in Bellevue Square?”
“That sounds great. I’m going to drive over in, say, twenty minutes or so. You know it’s only about five minutes from my place. Have you had lunch yet?”
“I haven’t yet. How about we get lunch first and then go shopping?”
“Perfect, I’m looking forward to seeing you; it’s been far too long!”
“I’ll say. Alright, I’ll see you soon, Maris.”
I grab a purse from the divan at the foot of my bed, mainly out of laziness. I could look through my collection to find one to match my shoes, but I have neither the inclination nor the energy. I leave the door to my room open, cornering Rosa in the hallway. “I would love it if you could get around to cleaning my room,” I tell her tersely. It’s a daily struggle to not focus on the rolls of her stomach or her overlapping teeth. “It’s getting a little messy.”
“I’m sorry, Miss Maris, you were sleeping, and I didn’t want to disturb you.” Her accent is thick, emetic. “I will get to it right away.”
“Please, I’d like fresh bedsheets at least once a year,” I say. “Or I’ll have you deported,” I add, under my breath. I watch her fat jiggling from the stairway as she attempts to wrangle the bulky vacuum cleaner into submission. She wears a regulation maid outfit that struggles to contain any part of her. She used to work at our hotel in New York, but Mother developed a bizarre fondness for her and brought her and her horde of illegal immigrant children to Seattle. They essentially sponge off us, and I don’t think there’s a husband in the picture. I don’t even know how anyone found it possible to impregnate her that many times. I think bestiality is a sin, but clearly Luis or Pedro or Julio didn’t agree. Rosa is an excellent cook, I must admit, but that doesn’t negate the nausea that comes with seeing her. The Hispanics seem to be flooding in, and my parents sure have contributed. California used to contain them, but now it’s bursting at the seams and the
H o ne y traT R A p
63
overflow is rushing into Washington. Thankfully, not many of them have the intellect to gain admission into any university at all, let alone mine. The blacks have been terribly maligned: many are beautiful, talented, and intelligent. The Jews are wealthy and entrepreneurial, but the Hispanics have no redeeming qualities. I could spend most of the day engrossed in the hypnotic jiggling of Rosa’s flesh, but I continue down the steps. The house seems empty, and I don’t see Millie’s or Mother’s keys on the table in the foyer. Perhaps I’ll get to skip the conversation Mother promised me last night.
Heather is at the front of Rhodes’ department store as promised, dressed in a pretty, sleeveless mustard‑yellow tunic and Candie’s mules. Her chestnut hair is parted to the side, flowing in a glossy cascade to her slim waist. She’s not at all butch and masculine like most of the lesbians I’ve encountered while out clubbing with the fags. They wear their hair short and often don men’s clothes and disgusting Birkenstock sandals. Their advances aren’t as outrageous and confronting as those from men but are nonetheless distressing. Heather is shy and unassuming. When I first met her, she’d never been with a woman. She’s tried dating men, many times, but none of her relationships have passed the one‑month stage. I honestly don’t blame her at all. Even if she weren’t a lesbian, males have little to offer. I give her a long hug, resisting the urge to run my fingers through her hair.
“Maris, you don’t know how happy I am to see you! We’ve been in Utah for the past two months, and I’ve been absolutely going out of my mind,” her arms still wrapped around my shoulders.
“Well, I haven’t been in Utah, thankfully, but I’ve missed you, too, Heather. Come, let’s go get lunch. The ethnic food here is a treat if you’ll recall.” I link my arm through hers and lead her to the food court. Her skin is smooth and soft against mine, no doubt due to the frangipani body lotion she uses religiously. While the male gays are shunned when showing affection to one
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
64
another in public, nobody thinks twice about two women with entwined arms.
“I’m starved, Honestly, I could even go for McDonald’s right now. A cheeseburger with fries and a large strawberry milkshake, oh and maybe an apple pie, I could have it all. I’ve been eating so much of this goddamn yogurt because of my diet, I want to die, I hate yogurt.”
“Heather, please, the last thing you need is a diet. let’s go to McDonald’s.” It’s not even a phony compliment. My hands can grip the entirety of her waist, and, even at five eleven, she barely tops 105 pounds.
I don’t like to admit it, but I adore fast food. I couldn’t go a week without it. Granted, a trip to a fast‑food restaurant will usually lead to me being keeled over a toilet bowl with a finger halfway down my throat, but that isn’t at all a deterrent. She orders her meal, substituting the strawberry shake with vanilla, and then I order the same. She pays in cash after my half‑hearted attempt to reach for my wallet. McDonald’s vanilla milkshakes are celestial. The one time I forced Rosa to emulate it at home, it ended up tasting like burned rubber, and I lost the desire for it for at least six months. I smile at the black cashier, a rarity in this area, and collect a tray from her, walking to an intimate table in the corner of the food court. I grab a handful of fries and shovel them into my mouth with the speed and intensity of a fat girl let loose in a chocolate shop. When Heather arrives, however, I return to the dignified manner of only eating one fry at a time. I take tiny bites of the cheeseburger, allowing myself the opportunity to speak without sounding uncouth.
“Maris, what have you been up to these few months? Your life is always so interesting and happening. The most exciting thing that happened to me this week was getting my dress back from the dry cleaners.” She sighs and sips her milkshake. Her dainty fingers draw an invisible star on the paper tray cover.
“I haven’t been doing that much since I got back from Europe. It’s a lot more boring around these parts when you’re not here. Are you staying for long?”
H o ne y traT R A p

She grins at me, her entire face animated with glee. “Well, I didn’t want to say anything beforehand, in case it wasn’t going to work out, but I’ll be staying in Seattle for a while. I got accepted into law school! It was either here or Utah, and god knows I can’t stand being around that piece of shit area anymore.”
“What, you mean you’re moving here?”
“I’ll be here as long as the University of Washington will have me!” She lets out a little squeal.
“Fuck, that is amazing, honey! It’s great you’re finally getting out that hellhole. I’m glad you haven’t been Mormonized yet.”
“Well, don’t get me wrong, Maris. I’d still like to have five wives.”
“I think an even number might be better, or perhaps seven, a different one for every night of the week.”
“Well, it wouldn’t be hard for a girl as pretty as you,” she tells me. “You could have anyone you wanted.”
“Not after this meal,” I say, dipping a fry into a pool of ketchup. “I don’t want to get on a scale after my holiday. I’m surprised I didn’t gain fifty pounds from all the paella in Spain. I don’t even like paella, I don’t know why I kept having it.” Fish disgusts me, extraordinarily so. All types of seafood wreak havoc on my taste buds. The worst is sushi or sashimi. If I wanted to eat raw and unseasoned fish, I’d go swimming in the damn ocean and grab some. “But tell me more, where are you going to stay, what’s your schedule like? We need to figure out a day during the week on which we can get lunch.”
“I think that’s more up to you. Medical school seems far more rigorous than law school, and you’re working with your dad, right?”
“Oh, well, I was supposed to be working today and yesterday, but here I am.”
She gasps as if a thought has just occurred to her, fawnlike eyes wide. “Dear lord, I can’t believe I forgot about it. I read about it in the morning papers and saw it on the news when I got here last night. Your poor friend…Carol, yes, Carol, she was abducted from Lake Sammamish? I feel so insensitive and rude for making K anikaANI K A B AT R A

you come out to see me. You must be wrought with grief. She’s such a sweet girl, although you only introduced us briefly.”
“Yes, uh, it was quite traumatic. Maybe the papers mentioned it, I mean, why would they, but I was with her that day.” I take a vast bite of the burger. “We were swimming and hanging out at the beach and then it became the worst day ever.”
“They actually did mention that you were there, Hunter Carlyle and girlfriend Maris Caldwell if I’m to quote verbatim.”
“Hmm, girlfriend to Hunter Carlyle, what a winning title.” I’m upset and a little surprised. I would imagine that the connection would be spun the opposite way, considering the value and worth of us individually. Hunter floats and drifts, tied down only by his wealthy lineage, while I’m more than a parasite who struck it lucky. His degree will culminate in nothing, and he’ll eventually become nothing more than an attractive figurehead for Carlyle Candy.
“It must be terrible for you. I hope she’s found safe and well.”
“I can’t bring myself to think about it. I don’t want to imagine Carol suffering or being held against her will. I want her to be in Snoqualmie with her other friends. I don’t want to think about it, I really don’t.”
“Of course, I’m sorry, Maris. I didn’t mean to be so obtuse about it all.”
“It’s not your fault. It’s a very strange situation to be in. I don’t even know how to grasp it myself! Look, why don’t we walk around the shops, looking at dresses should get our minds off this. Well, if I can fit into any of them anymore, that is.”
“Don’t play that game with me. Your figure is unbelievable.”
“Come, come, come, let’s go to Nordstrom down in the Bellevue Collection,” I say, taking a final sip of my milkshake. “There are so many things I shouldn’t be buying, but I will anyway.”
She finishes off her meal quickly, dabbing the remnants of the apple pie away with a serviette. I drag her through the opulent mall, passing one designer shop after another to finally reach Nordstrom. Six stories high and about a mile wide, it has every
H o ne y traT R A p
67
conceivable item of clothing a woman would ever need. I could get swept away in the silky fabrics and dizzying fragrances.
“Are you looking to buy anything in particular?” she asks me, looking around in awe. I’m not sure if she’s been here before.
“Maybe some blue jeans and slacks, though I wouldn’t mind a few new dresses too. Do you need anything?” I grab a pair of bellbottoms from a Levi’s rack and a forest‑green mini dress. Father’s quite generous with his monthly allowances to Millie and me, and Millie doesn’t keep tabs on her credit card, which happens to be sitting quietly in my wallet. I add a pair of gold, shimmery hot pants to the growing pile on my arm.
“I could definitely use some new clothes, maybe things that allow me to show my ankles. It’s not done in Utah,” she says, giggling. “Maybe some new bras too. I barely have anything stylish.”
I stare at her lissome body, rapt by the gentle sway of her hips and her small but well‑shaped chest. She blushes, and I look away.
“Why don’t you try some on?” I suggest. I select a see‑through Chantelle demi‑cup number, teal with pretty little flowers. I hand it to her and head to the dressing room. I smile politely at the saleslady manning the overflowing racks of clothes. She directs me to a stall. Heather follows me in. She drops the pretense, her fingers tracing along the back of my neck, and I drop the clothes I’m holding. She pins me against the mirror and kisses me, ardent and forceful. I cling to her waist, drawing her in sharply. My breath catches in my chest, and I unzip her tunic. Her soft lips taste of vanilla. They yield to mine without struggle. I lose myself in her, my control evaporating around me. She’s warm and inviting, her body a sheltered haven in the middle of a rainstorm. She kisses my neck and unties the sweater from around my shoulders. I gasp as she runs her delicate hand up my thigh.
“I’ve really missed you,” she tells me, playing with the waistband of my underwear. “Hunter gets too much of you. It’s not fair.”
“I can’t argue with you there,” I say, unhooking her bra.

CHAPTER SIX
I can remember a time when I was very little, likely no more than four or five‑years‑old. It was winter, snowing, and blustery outside. Millie and I weren’t in school yet, and we’d been staying in our parents’ chalet in Sun Valley with our (mostly) sober mother. She was in one of her depressive spirals and had sat us down before the fireplace. She ran her fingers through my hair gently while braiding it. I had on a ruby red turtleneck and a heavy sweater with a teddy bear on the front; it was my favorite. We were meant to go skiing, but Mother was too tired, and Father had left much earlier in the day. It was a paltry excuse of my mother’s. She’s never been the outdoorsy type. Her form of exercise was primarily stirring martinis and swiping Father’s credit card. She wouldn’t have been able to ski to save her life.
She was affectionate during her depression. I don’t know if it was from a place of honesty or loneliness. If she didn’t have Father around, we’d suffice. I was wriggling around because I wanted to wear my hair loose like hers or in one of those beehives she’d make if she planned to go out. She thought children oughtn’t be dressed up like women; it was unbecoming.
It was late afternoon, and the Swiss au pair had made Millie and me hot chocolate before she was done for the day. Mine was in a thermos container and stone‑cold as I sipped it. Millie was splayed out on her tummy, beside me, waiting for her turn, engrossed in a coloring book. We’d only gotten trims up till that point, so our hair was about hip length, but hers was blonde and mine had been dark since birth. Mother nestled me in her bony,
69
emaciated embrace to settle me and then returned to the braids. Her cup of coffee sat untouched on the table. Had I the wisdom then as I do now, I would’ve understood it was laced with Kahlua. She’s very fond of exotic alcoholic drinks that masquerade as acceptable day-time beverages.
Her hands were cold, permanently cold, and she wore a cashmere wrap. Her face was puffy as if she’d been crying but when I asked, she was evasive. “Mommy’s very tired, Maris,” she’d tell me. “Finish your cocoa.” Her nails were manicured, curved into arches that were kind to my scalp. She’d make two long, fishtailed braids and secure them as one with a white ribbon.
The smell of firewood was intermingled with the smoke from her cigarette she’d denied having, with absolute vehemence. She told us cigarettes were disgusting. They’d rot your teeth, age your skin, and stunt your growth. She’d smoke out on the terrace in the snow when she assumed we were occupied or sleeping. Without the assistance of makeup, she had clear skin, bee‑stung lips, and beautiful, heavy‑lidded eyes, but she would only allow Millie and me (and occasionally the au pairs and nannies) to see her in her natural state. She primped and primed when she was to see Father or society women or the dark‑haired man who’d drop by in the middle of the day while Father was gone. Her moods were unpredictable, but she was usually nicest on her down days.
“Mommy loves both of you so much,” she said, tying a small bow with the ribbon. She smiled at me, her eyes swollen with the remnants of a thick, heavy “Sometimes it’s very hard, you know, just very hard to…” Quite frankly, no, I didn’t know.
“Mommy, please don’t cry,” Millie said, swiping at Mother’s face with a Crayola‑stained hand.
“I’m not crying, Millicent. I’m tired.” Her tone was sharp, cruel. It was one that was reserved for her and the maids. She’d divide Millie and me when necessary, pitting us against each other, and other times she’d dress us identically. She’d play bizarre games that I still haven’t come to understand. The sleeves of Mother’s woolen sweater were rolled up at the elbows. Her forearms were bruised purple with lingering finger imprints. She always had
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
70
bruises when Father was around. “Now, come on, sit still honey,” she cooed, giving me a gentle kiss on the temple. “Don’t you want to look pretty?”
“I want to look like you, Mommy. I don’t want to tie up my hair,” I whined, held in place by her unmoving legs. “Please.”
“I don’t want you to argue with me, pussycat, sit still.”
I tried to push against her. I was small, but she was fragile. It had been an even competition at that point, and I’d managed to break free. Her weakness morphed rapidly into rage—her palm crashed against my face with colossal force. I sobbed. Her smacks were unrelenting. She dragged me to her by the hair and rained blows upon me till I was hysterical and had curled in on myself. Millie watched on silently, not attempting to intervene. She knew better than that, and I knew never to count on her to stop a beating. I had to wait until Mother had it out of her system, until she hovered over me, howling almost as heavily as I was. My skin set alight. I burned and ached and cried. Her hands became fists, and her anger found its outlet in my tiny body. I could’ve fought back, but I didn’t. I escaped in my mind.
* * *
I’m sitting at the counter of the Oak Bar, a feature of Father’s new downtown hotel. I’m drinking a martini with more olive than gin. The bartender is a talker, yappy as all hell. His nose warrants its own goddamn zip code. I don’t know how he made it through the rigorous recruitment process. He seems to possess the intelligence of a gnat, but I suppose it could be attributed to affirmative action—the Hispanics need jobs too. I nod and smile politely as he jabbers on about how exciting he’s finding Seattle to be. I had plans to meet Hunter for dinner at Canlis, but I’m in no mood to see him nor try their dry‑aged duck. I’ve satiated my hunger with a truffle oil grilled cheese sandwich instead.
The bar is quite busy for a Thursday evening. I see people on awkward first dates and businessmen discussing deals over Manhattans. I’m tired, drained. I went to bed at 6 AM after H o ne y traT R A p
71
watching Psycho on television and couldn’t get back to sleep when I awoke around ten in the morning. I order another martini and wait for the spic to realize that I won’t need a payment method. I hope Father is at home and isn’t hovering nearby. I twirl the olives in the alcohol before I take a bite, noticing as a boy slides into a seat on the other end of the counter. He’s remarkable to a level that leaves me staring dumbfounded. His eyes are a luminescent light blue, perceptible from this distance, and his hair is dark, as dark as mine. He’s built slim and his jaw and cheekbones are deftly carved as if out of porcelain. A blonde girl galumphs on to the stool beside him. She’s unfortunate‑looking, with the undefined chest of a twelve-year-old boy and thighs the size of Texas. He seems rather disinterested in her, but I recognize the desire in her gaze.
I readjust the straps of my cocktail dress, to maximize the view of my (rather impressive if I do say so myself — yes, I know it’s uncouth, but it’s true) cleavage. She seems desperate for his attention, and at this point, I don’t really blame her. I have to physically remind myself to look away once I meet his eyes. All I want is to linger. He stares at me until the blonde grabs his arm and forces him to face her.
I turn back to my drink, stealing glances at every available opportunity, noticing how the color in his cheeks contours his smooth skin. I engage with the bartender to distract myself. His unpleasant face momentarily douses the overwhelming need. I’m almost nervous, but the alcohol is doing its job, steadying me. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone as attractive as this boy. I’m a lightweight, so the three martinis are making me tipsy. My body tingles from a cocktail of lust, adrenaline, and searing alcohol. Nerves are not normally something I have to deal with. I don’t feel much, at most I’d be bored or high, so I don’t understand the twinge in the pit of my stomach. The girl’s grip on his arm is claw‑like and remains steady as if she were grasping on for dear life. I don’t know how she’s managed to be on a date with him, perhaps his self‑esteem is as low as her neckline. He seems K anikaANI K A B AT R A
72
unsure of himself, his movements a little clumsy and lacking the arrogance that usually accompanies a terrific-looking male.
“Say, bartender, would you mind doing a favor for me? I need to use the telephone, and I don’t want to have to go back up to my room.”
“Of course, miss, let me bring you the telephone,” he tells me, or at least I think so, his accent making his speech almost undecipherable. “Are you calling your boyfriend?”
“How did you know?” I grab the black rotary phone from him and take my time dialing, attempting to keep my focus away from the boy. I can picture Hunter rousing from a Xanax induced slumber to pretty himself for our date. Hunter is very concerned with his appearance, and oftentimes he’ll take longer to get dressed than I will. He’s the vainest son of a bitch I’ve ever known. I call him and let him know I’m terribly unwell, wrought with worry about Carol and coming down with the flu. He is a little slow, but he still manages to realize the noise surrounding me is not of that in my bedroom, and I explain that I was forced to visit the hotel with Father. I look up at the boy despite myself, losing my trail of thought. “No, no, Hunter, don’t you worry about me. I should be alright, you don’t need to come over and keep me company, I plan to go home and right to bed.”
“Are you sure?” His voice is insistent like it usually is when he wants to get laid.
“I’m perfectly sure, I’ll phone you tomorrow, alright?” I don’t wait for a response and hang up. I watch as the needy blonde gets up and walks unsteadily toward the bathroom, entirely out of place in her heels. The boy is left alone for a moment, and he looks at me and sips what appears to be a gin and tonic with lemon. I grin at him, and he smiles back. “Listen, bartender, will you go over and find out what that young man is drinking?” I ask of Luis or Pedro or whatever the fuck his name is. “I want you to give him another one on the house.”
“Yes, miss, of course. Uh, I’m not sure if I can put it on the house, though. I don’t have that kind of authority.”
H o ne y traT R A p
73
“Do you not know who I am? I’m Maris Caldwell. My father owns this hotel among, say, one hundred fifty others, so don’t worry about your authority,” I tell him curtly. “I have enough to cover us both, and likely everyone else in the bar too.” I hold back instead of threatening to report him to the immigration department.
“I’m very sorry, I didn’t know. I’ll go and find out, alright?”
“Yes, thank you, I appreciate it.” I sit still, playing with the olive pick to settle myself. I need to get a fucking grip.
“He’s having a gin and tonic with a twist. I’ll prepare another for him, miss.”
“Great, thank you.” I run my fingers through my hair, fanning it evenly over my shoulder. Mother always told us it was indecent to touch up makeup outside of the ladies’ room, so I restrict myself to a quick check in my compact mirror. I drain the martini and leave the remaining olive in the glass. Only ugly people ought to suffer this kind of nervousness. I stand up, smoothing the silken fabric of my dress down over my hips and walk to him. The blonde is still absent, no doubt powdering her face maniacally in the bathroom to try to gain any possible semblance of attractiveness.
“So, what do you think of the hotel?” I ask, standing beside him. “I don’t know if I care for the décor.”
He turns to look at me, tracing the rim of his fresh glass with his finger. When he meets my gaze, he blushes. “Oh, um, I think it’s nice but, yeah, I don’t know, maybe the décor is a bit much.” He motions nervously at the five‑tiered chandelier.
“Maybe I should’ve picked a different light fixture then.” I smile.
“Wait, what? Did you pick that out?”
“Yes, I picked out most of the stuff in here. I thought the oak for the counter was a good move, though, considering the name of the bar.”
“Are you the interior decorator here? I didn’t mean to insult you. You look too young to have been the decorator, I’m very sorry.”

“I’m kidding, I’m the daughter, I didn’t pick any of this. I’m Maris,” I say, laughing. I extend my hand to him. While his demeanor is anxious, his grip is firm.
“I’m Charles, or Charlie, depending on who I’m talking to. It’s great to meet you. So, your folks designed this place?”
His face is particularly distracting. “No, I’m fairly sure they hired people to do it. Dad wanted his first hotel in his hometown to be just terrific.” I remind myself to blink and look away.
“Oh, holy shit, you own this joint? Melissa, uh, the girl I’m here with, said it had a great bar and restaurant.”
“Was she right? I think my parents would be thrilled to hear that.”
“Yeah, she really was. I appreciate you sending the drink over, too, by the way. Are you staying here?”
“No, I live a couple of miles away. I probably shouldn’t be driving since I’ve had a few drinks, but I like taking risks. Are you here on vacation?”
“God no, I don’t know who’d want to go to Seattle on a vacation, not even in July for the three days of summer. I live in Ellensburg.”
“You’re my type of person. I try to spend as much time outside of Seattle as I can too.”
“It sucks, doesn’t it? At least it’s a little better than Ellensburg. The people here still have teeth.” He reaches into the pocket of his t‑shirt and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. “Would you like one?”
“That would be great, thanks. I’ve just run out.” I place it in between my lips, and he lights it for me before lighting his own. I watch as the blonde returns from the bathroom, attempting to steady her balance in her shoes. I almost feel secondhand embarrassment for her—it’s one hideous sight. The dress stretches awkwardly over her ham legs and her purse looks like the one my grandmother was buried with. She notices me rather quickly, confused, and anxious. I don’t know how she’s here with him, I really don’t. It’s making me uncomfortable. There ought to be order in the world. Her inelegance exemplifies that girls like her
H o ne y traT R A p
75
don’t belong with men this attractive, nor in bars as exclusive as mine.
“Charlie, you have a new friend,” she says condescendingly, settling into her bar stool. “Hi, I’m Melissa, Charles’s girlfriend.”
“Maris here owns the joint,” says the boy, only briefly looking her way. He’s fidgety and nervous—his attempts to disguise this are far from successful. I’m struggling as much if not more. This is a new sensation for me. I don’t enjoy it.
She laughs. “Are you kidding?”
“Maris Caldwell. It’s a pleasure to meet you,” I say, forcing a grin.
“Oh wow, you’re not kidding. I brought Charlie here. I heard it was a very classy new place. He’s not usually into this kind of stuff. We got a suite—I thought it would be nice to go out for a night.”
“I’m sure you’ll have a lovely time. There’s a fantastic view as long as you’re not on a floor lower than five. You can see the Cascades and the whole city from the penthouse.”
“I think if you put our incomes for a year together, we still wouldn’t have enough to rent the penthouse for a night,” she tells me caustically.
Poor people always have a chip on their shoulder, blaming others for their failures and lack of drive. I’m not sure whether her tone is one of derision or envy, but neither concerns me. Judgment from the impoverished is about as valuable as the trash my maid cleans out. I smile at her. “Well, I don’t believe it’s booked out today. I was planning on going home, but I might stay here. You’re more than welcome to come up and check it out. There’s a private bar inside too.”
“That’s so generous, we’d love t—” starts the boy.
“We might stay in our own suite, thanks,” she interrupts, hackles raised. “We appreciate the offer.”
“I completely understand, I hope you both enjoy your night. If you change your mind, feel free to pop by. The elevator around the corner goes directly to the penthouse—you need to let the operator know who you’re visiting, and they’ll buzz you up.”

76
“You’re wonderful, really. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a penthouse.”
“No, of course you haven’t, Charles. You dropped out of college and work at Waldenbooks,” says the blonde. “This is like, what, the first hotel you’ve been to?” Her tone is cruel, scathing.
“I love Waldenbooks, working there would be great, it really would. I wouldn’t be able to control myself, though, I’d probably buy everything I could,” I say, soothing the obvious injury.
“Well, he’s not academically inclined, general book reading included.”
“That’s not true, though is it, Melissa?” His voice is sharp. “I’m sorry, she seems to be having an issue with her attitude tonight.”
While I would usually back away from this situation (I’d rather not spend time licking the wounds of other people), I’m compelled to stay, rooted in my spot. “I feel terrible, I wanted to come over and say hello, I don’t mean to interrupt anything here, I may go up to my room,” I say with reluctance. “Have a lovely evening.”
I walk across the bar toward the lobby. While the bartender failed to recognize me, the bellboys haven’t. They smile at me as I make my way to the front desk. Manned by twelve women in matching navy‑blue blazers and skirts, the reception is swift and effective.
“Good evening, Miss Caldwell. What a pleasure to see you here! What can we do for you?” The redhead flashes a smile at me dutifully.
“Hi Candice, how are you today?”
“I’m very well thank you, how are you?”
“I’m doing well but, as you can probably tell, a little drunk. I don’t think I ought to risk a DUI, so I wanted to check into the penthouse—Daddy did mention it wasn’t booked for tonight.” I slur my words slightly for effect.
She pauses for a brief moment, flicking through bookings. “You’re in luck, Millie! It is free tonight.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful. I’ll check out before noon, so I shouldn’t be too much of a bother.”
H o ne y traT R A p
77
“You’re never a bother, Miss Caldwell. Do you have anything you’d like me to send up, any luggage? Would you like anything from room service?”
“I don’t have anything with me, but I would absolutely love some French fries. The biggest portion, some stuffed artichokes and a bottle of Coke.”
“No problem at all, here’s your key.”
“Listen, if I get any visitors, please make sure they’re sent up right away.” I smile at her, sliding her a hundred as I grab the key.
She blushes, greedily snatching the bill off the counter and shoving it into the front pocket of her blazer. “I’ll be sure to do that.”
“Thank you, honey, have yourself a great night.”
The elevator for the penthouse is spectacular, with gold panels and only three buttons: one for the roof, one for the lobby, and one for the telephone. It’s cordoned off with red velvet rope but is otherwise invisible to those who cannot afford it. A bellboy walks with me, offering to take my purse from me as he ushers me in. I let him carry it. I tell him to set it down on the divan in the foyer. He waits expectantly for his tip, and I shove a twenty into his palm. “That’ll be all for tonight, thanks. Go on and get yourself a drink.” I offer him a quick smile.
“Oh wow, thanks, Miss Caldwell, please let me know if you need anything else.”
I wait for him to leave before I strip down to my slip and pour myself a glass of red wine from the fully stocked bar. I know it’s well‑aged and too expensive for my father to allow me to drink. I take the small plastic baggie of coke out of my bag and empty it out onto the countertop, dividing it into neat little lines. I do two lines and sway backward on my heels, reeling. It’s terrific stuff, it really is. I’d swiped it from Hunter’s stash a little while ago and I’d expected it to be subpar, like everything else in his life. I’m glad it’s not. I sit on the enormous bed to steady myself. Cocaine and alcohol on an empty stomach can do wonders in the way of head spins. The curtains are drawn, and the panoramic view of the twinkling lights of the Seattle skyline is dazzling. As
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
78
I lean over and manage an unsophisticated attempt to take off my shoes, there’s a knock. My stomach growls in anticipation of the French fries.
“The door is open —just roll the table in, please!” I call.
“What do you mean?” asks a male voice.
“The room service, of course.” I sigh, walking to the door.
“Oh, uh, no I’m not from the hotel. It’s Charlie, we just met downstairs?”
As much as I could use the food, I feel elated. I pull the door open.
“Oh shit, I didn’t mean to catch you at a bad time,” he says, glancing at my outfit or lack thereof. “I can leave!”
I laugh. “Don’t be silly, come on in. Can I get you a drink?”
“I’ll have whatever you’re having, and maybe some of that room service you’re expecting.”
“How do you know I didn’t order liverwurst?” I ask, grinning.
“Lucky me, I adore liverwurst.” He laughs.
“It’s a shame I’m only getting French fries, then.” I look up at him as I pour his glass of wine, still flustered.
“Look, it’s not my first preference. I do prefer raw organs, but sure, I’ll have some of those instead.”
“I like your ability to compromise.” I hoist myself up onto the counter. “So, how do you like the penthouse? I hope it’s all that I made it out to be.”
“I’m not used to anything this fancy. I thought our room on the second floor was a palace.” He looks around in awe at the granite and ivory kitchen, the ten‑seater dining table, and the lavish sunken lounge room, eventually setting his gaze on the view. “You can see the Cascades from here.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever been to Ellensburg, well, not that I recall, but I hope this is a slight improvement. Where’s your girlfriend, uh, Melissa was it?” I take a sip, crossing my legs, and try not to stare. This is the pedigree of boyfriend I need in my life. I can’t imagine any of my friends having an accessory so beautiful. It seems unfair that a girl like Melissa, with all the grace and beauty of an old sow, would be with him.
H o ne y traT R A p

“Well, unless you’re interested in the rodeo it’s a cesspit, so anything is an improvement. This, however, is incredible. I can’t believe you own it.”
“My parents are still alive, so, technically, I don’t own it yet.”
“I’d move to Seattle if I could live like this. It’s terrific, it really is. Melissa planned this little trip a while ago but wanted to change hotels since this one opened. She freaked when she heard about the kids our age going missing around here.”
“Oh yeah, it’s a bummer. I can’t believe what’s happening. Is she down in your suite now?”
“We had a bit of an argument about coming up here. I wanted to. She didn’t. She’s probably sulking right now, but am I a bit of a bastard if I say I don’t care?”
I laugh. “No, she sounded out of line at the bar, honestly. Have you been dating for very long?”
“A couple of months, I think. She lives near me and was persistent, so I thought I’d go for it. I don’t know too many girls.” He laughs. “Shit, I keep embarrassing myself. I should stop talking.”
I can’t decide whether he’s being dishonest or is genuinely unaware of his attractiveness. My ability to read people usually works far better, but I feel like my brain is wrapped in cling film. Nothing’s functioning as it ought to. “I find that difficult to believe,” I say slowly, carefully, my brain struggling to formulate a proper sentence.
“That she was persistent?” He looks confused.
“No, that you don’t know many girls. I mean, look at you.”
“I guess it’s not that I don’t know them, I haven’t had too much luck. Melissa asked me a few times if I’d like to take her to dinner so, eventually, I did, and it progressed.”
“You shouldn’t be embarrassed. It’s just me here.”
His hands are trembling a little, and there’s the slight sheen of sweat on his forehead. He isn’t lying.
“I’ve had trouble myself,” I add.
“You’re kidding me. You’re the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen. Melissa would be furious if she heard any of this.”

“Well, it’s convenient that Melissa isn’t here. How’s your wine, would you like some more?”
“So I can sound like an even bigger moron when I get drunk? Probably not, I’ll wait for the fries.”
“Fuck, I don’t know what’s taking them so long. I’m starving. And, in case you haven’t noticed, a little high.”
“You don’t look high. You’re very composed.”
“I’m in my undergarments, drinking wine on the kitchen counter with a boy I’ve known for all of an hour.” I start laughing. “But I’m glad you consider that composed.”
“You’ve got a point there. But I’m kind of drunk, so my judgment may or may not be skewed.”
“Room service,” calls a female voice from the hallway. I hop off the counter and hurry to the door as fast as my heels can carry me.
“Come in! Roll the table in, please,” I say. The portion of fries is about the size of my head and the artichokes look delicious. Charles helps the little orderly push the trolley in.
“Can I get you anything else, Miss Caldwell?” She looks uneasy when she notices my lack of clothing.
“Oh no, not at all, thank you!” I sign the invoice and add a fifty‑dollar tip. I feel generous tonight. I close the door behind her as she hurries out.
“Dig in or I’ll beat you to it,” I say to Charles, popping several fries into my mouth at once.
“Stuffed artichokes, oh lord, these are my favorite!” He says it with child‑like excitement. “I am so, so hungry. Do you know how expensive the food is at your hotel?”
I start laughing. “Yeah, you could say it’s a little steep. But these are cooked in truffle oil and that shit is expensive.”
“Alright, this tastes like it should for five‑dollar French fries. I don’t know what truffle oil is, but I think I like it.”
“Well, that’s good. I don’t think I could ever be friends with a person who dislikes truffle oil.” I cut the artichoke delicately with the tip of the knife, separating it into two portions. “So, are you staying here for tonight?”

“That was the plan if Melissa even lets me back into the room. I walked out…not very amicably. She paid for it so, technically, she can keep me out. We were planning on going white water rafting in the Yakima tomorrow morning, but I might drive back to Ellensburg instead.”
“Oh, I hear the weather tomorrow will be dreadful—rain all day. But the news stations have lied before. You’re more than welcome to stay up here if Melissa is still angry. There are several bedrooms—one down here and one upstairs that opens into the rooftop pool.”
“I wouldn’t want to put you out like that,” he tells me after swallowing a bite of the artichoke. “You’re way too nice.”
“It’s no big deal, there’s plenty of room. Plus, I don’t want to be presumptuous, but you probably wouldn’t like being back on the second floor after having the penthouse suite. Our butler service is pretty nice too.”
“There’s a butler here? Holy shit.”
“Yes, though they’re taught to be invisible whenever possible—they’ll run a bath for you or help pack your clothes and disappear when you don’t need them.”
“You’re incredibly lucky to have all this. Back home, Mom cooks everything—and by cook, I mean she’ll toss a TV dinner into the oven and let us, my brother Chris, and sister Billie, and me, salvage whatever’s edible.”
“What’s Billie short for? I have a sister named Millie, coincidentally. She’s twenty‑three minutes younger than I am.”
“Her name’s Wilhelmina, but she thinks it makes her sound like she’s forty‑five, so she insists on being called Billie. Is Millie short for Camilla?”
“Millicent, but I think Camilla would be nicer. I suppose we’re lucky, but if you met our parents you might reconsider. If we didn’t have staff at home, we’d probably be eating TV dinners too. The last thing Mother made us was mac and cheese back in 1960. Or maybe it was 1959. The idea of her cooking is bizarre. All I remember is that I was very little.”

“Do you guys usually live in the hotels? If I had hotels, I don’t think I’d ever leave.” He looks around the place again in admiration.
“No, our father wanted us to grow up like ‘regular kids’ so, at most we’d spend a night or two in our hotels during their grand openings. Our house is in Bellevue, but we were always in Colorado and New York too.”
“What’s New York like? I’ve never left Washington before.” He dips a fry into the tiny bowl of ketchup, and I make a mental note to complain to my father about portion sizing.
“It’s probably my favorite city in the world, so I could be biased, but it’s wonderful. It’s always buzzing with people and events, and you don’t get bored. I mean, sure, a taxi driver may run you over, but at least you’ll get a bit of adrenaline in you.”
“I like the way you describe it. It sounds better than drinking enough beer to make you unconscious at Bleachers every Thursday.”
“Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been pretty intoxicated plenty of times at Club 82 in New York but definitely not from beer. The party scene is wild. Alcohol often doesn’t even make an appearance.”
“I’ve always wanted to go to New York. Hell, I’d even go to damn Montana if it meant getting out of here, you know?”
His delicate features are overcome with melancholy. I feel the urge to reach out and hold him to me. His long, dark eyelashes shadow the blue, attempting to hide any visible signs of pain as he stares at the floor. When he looks up at me, finally, he grins, and my stomach ties into a little knot. I’m craving him, watching his masculine hands, and wishing they were on me.
“Well, we have a hotel there, and I’m sure I could arrange a booking for a week or two for you and Melissa if you’d like.”
“I think if I pushed it hard enough, my ratty car might get me there. I’d park it a block or two away from the hotel, though. I wouldn’t want to scare any of your guests away.”
H o ne y traT R A p

“My car is pretty shitty too. I haven’t been able to drive much lately at all, what, with all the work it needs,” I lie, attempting to give him comfort.
“I’m going to guess you have a Mercedes. Or a BMW.”
“You’re close but no dice.” I smile at him despite myself. “It’s a Porsche.”
“Please tell me it’s red.”
“I wanted it to be. It’s blue.”
“You’ve disappointed me, Maris,” he tells me, shaking his head. “I thought you were better than that.” He bursts into glorious, musical trills of laughter. I observe his mouth, the full lips, smooth as mine, and the sparkling teeth. His neck is slender, the ends of his hair meeting tenuously at the nape. “But it sure beats Melissa’s Volkswagen.”
“She’s a pretty girl,” I say. I pry slowly. I want intimate details of his relationship and how to dismantle it.
“She’s alright, I guess. I mean she’s skinny and all, there’re plenty of girls uglier than her.”
“That sounds like a glowing recommendation,” I joke. “I’m sure she’d love to hear that. Any girl would.”
“I don’t mean to be rude or anything, after all, we’re dating, but she’s not what I expected. But I care about her, I do.”
I want to wrap him around me like one of those elegant silk Hermes scarves Mother has hanging on every hook in her cupboards. “I’m sure you do, but I feel New York is the kind of city that needs to be explored alone. All the little shops and alleys and quaint cafés in SoHo, you don’t absorb them as well when you’re with someone.”
“You seem more like a Park Avenue girl, to be honest,” he tells me.
“How would you know that if you’ve never been to New York?” I retort lightly, knocking back the rest of my drink.
“Well, Billie leaves her Vogue magazines lying around the house sometimes, and you know…I get bored. I always like a little night reading.” His smile is sheepish.

“Do you mean you like looking at skinny girls in expensive lingerie?”
“No, of course not…alright, maybe, but doesn’t every guy?”
“Did you see the January edition of this year?”
“Jesus fucking Christ, you’re the one in the blue and red sets, aren’t you?”
“I’ll have you know I was also in the ankle‑length Alberta Ferretti dress—it had a turtleneck too; very conservative.”
“You looked…I don’t have words.”
“I know, even I was ashamed of how the Ferretti dress looked.”
He moves closer to me, his clothed thigh against my bare one and there’s a sudden buzz that I can’t blame on alcohol or cocaine. When his skin touches mine, I shiver involuntarily. I feel heat rush to my face, and I hope I’m not blushing as hard as I think I am. My skin has the very annoying tendency to flush deeply, embarrassing me, and ruining my face in one swift hit.
“Maybe you could show me around New York City,” he tells me, taking my hand in his own.
I guide myself toward him. I stare into the bottomless ocean. “Yeah, I suppose I probably could,”
He tilts my chin up to him and brushes his lips against mine, soft and sweet. He tastes like honeyed wine and strawberries, and I can smell faint cigarette smoke lingering on his shirt. I hold back, allowing him to take control, partially because I can execute none of my own. My body is frozen in position, from a combination of adrenaline and desire. He kisses me again gently. His lips are indulgently soft, throwing me off guard.
“I’m really sorry, I shouldn’t have done that,” he says as he retreats, unsure of himself. “You were so lovely taking me in and all when you had no reason to.”
“You shouldn’t have stopped.” I brush his hair back and kiss him on the side of his neck. I breathe him in. He has the right mix of aftershave, cologne, and smoke, with his natural scent slightly overpowering the cocktail. It makes me a little giddy.
“Melissa is downstairs, and I think you’re too drunk. I don’t want to take advantage.”
H o ne y traT R A p
85
“I’m not drunk.”
“You’re one of the prettiest girls I’ve ever seen,” he repeats.
My body aches for him. “I’m not drunk.”
He kisses me again.
This time I respond eagerly. “I told you. I’m not drunk.”
I’ve rarely felt more conscious. Each sense is pulsing. His hand on my hip, the sound of his voice, the smell of his skin, the beautiful angles of his face, the taste of him. My senses overwhelm me. I want to rip off his shirt with my teeth, but things stay gentle. He’s tender, his nimble fingers tracing the edges of my thong, never once stepping outside the confines of decency. “Your skin is so smooth,” he tells me quietly, in between kisses. “Are you certain you don’t have a boyfriend? Look at you.”
“I think I’d remember, Charles.” I grin at him. “Boyfriends are parasitic; they’re hard to forget.”
He’s laughing, and I take the moment to unbutton his shirt. I kiss him on the neck.
“We shouldn’t do this. We really shouldn’t. I want to take you out, you know, to a nice place. One of those fancy joints in Bellevue. They’ve got some very good French food, I hear.”
“I’ve been to my fair share of fancy restaurants. They bore me. You don’t.”
“Does your dad own them too?”
“No, I don’t think he’s acquiring restaurants at the moment. I think he’s pretty busy overlooking the management of our hotels.” My kisses grow urgent as my body tingles.
“I want to take you out somewhere nice, Maris. Wine and dine, you know? I’ve always wanted to do that for a girl, but I’ve never had the opportunity, especially not with someone who looks like you.”
“Do you not want to be with me?” I ask sullenly, lying flat on the bed. I fight the urge to cry. I want to feel him in me, the heat of his body on mine. I want to hear his shallow breath and light moans. I want to feel his heart race. “Because I can totally understand if you don’t.”

“Don’t be silly. Look, I’d probably sell my soul to the devil for a girl like you.”
“Then what’s the problem?” The tears scald my eyes, ready to drip one by one down my face to ensure my humiliation.
“I want to treat you properly. I don’t want to take advantage of you. I don’t want to be the guy you see cheating on his girlfriend because I wouldn’t want you to think of me like that.”
I’m not used to rejection. I feel sick to my stomach. “Alright, well, I guess that’s your decision to make,” I tell him stiffly. I swallow hard to keep my voice level. I draw myself into a sitting position as far away as I can be from him physically, considering the space constraints. When he reaches for my arm, I shift backward, avoiding his hand.
“I hope you’re not upset. I want to do this properly, you know. I’ve never been able to,” he says.
It makes me queasy as if it were a pity thing. He’s pitying me. This is mortifying. The pain is visceral like someone’s set me on fire from within.
“Oh, I completely understand. Don’t worry at all.” I force a rigid smile. “Can I get you anything else? The bar is pretty well stocked, or we could get more room service.”
“Would you mind if I got myself a scotch?”
“Ooh a scotch man, you’re wild,” I say, faking my laugh. “I’ll make you one. Neat?”
“On the rocks…I’m not that much of a scotch man, but I hear it impresses girls.”
“Oh, it sure does. It’s irresistible, truly, the height of masculinity,” I quip, kicking off my heels as I walk to the bar. I collect ice cubes from the tray and place them into a tumbler, pouring a cascade of blue label over them. I hand him his drink as he sits at the foot of the bed. “My father has some very nice things to say about this scotch.”
He takes a sip and then attempts to hide a wince. “Shit, this is strong.”
I stifle whatever remains of my rage and pour myself a tall glass of the golden liquor, without ice. “It’s not that bad,” I say
H o ne y traT R A p

after I gulp down half. I yawn and stretch my arms above my head. “You know, I’m getting super tired. Must be all the food, and I’m sure the alcohol has played its part. I’m going to bed if that’s alright. You’re more than welcome to stay here if you like. There’re several other beds.”
“No, I couldn’t impose on you like that.”
“Don’t worry. It’s hardly an imposition. I’m tiny, I don’t need three California king beds to myself.”
“I should really go home. Honestly, I’m in no mood to see Melissa. Could I please get your phone number? I don’t think I can even try to hide my interest. We could go out to dinner and watch a movie, whichever movie you like.”
“Oh, uh, that’s sweet of you. I’m busy these days, you know, with college coming up and all, and a couple of photo shoots with swimwear companies. I shouldn’t be lounging around, and I definitely shouldn’t be off my diet like I was tonight. It was lovely meeting you.” I smile coolly, leading him to the door. I withdraw when he tries to touch me, shirking out of his way.
“Are you saying you don’t want to see me? I hope I didn’t upset you.”
“No, sure, sure, I’d like to see you. Say, leave your number down at concierge, and I’ll give you a ring whenever I’m free, okay?”
“Can’t I just have your number?”
“I’ll get in touch with you, don’t worry.” I usher him outside. He looks forlorn and confused. He leans in to hug me, and I instinctively step away. My pride is too overwhelming. I close the door on his face.
Once he’s gone, I curl up in the bed, wrap the quilt tightly around myself and cry.

CHAPTER SEVEN
When I arrive home from the penthouse suite, dressed sinfully in last night’s clothing, I’m accosted by my father. It’s five minutes past 10 AM, and I’m certain there’s still a little aftermath swelling around my eyes from the crying, so I have on a pair of outdated Chanel sunglasses. I slept at three and woke at seven, groggy and disoriented. I lay still on the bed for a while, maybe an hour or two, fighting the exhaustion and nausea. It’s not even helpful exhaustion. It makes you listless—you’re unable to do anything productive, but you’re not drowsy enough to knock out. I took some Xanax to get back to sleep but got only an extra hour. When I turned on the television, all the channels were playing footage of Carol’s mother sobbing and shaky, begging the public to report anything they saw or knew about Carol’s disappearance to the police. I showered, threw up a little of the excess alcohol, and brushed my teeth raw.
“Maris, where have you been?” asks Daddy, his arms crossed.
“Oh, I wanted to check out the developments in the hotel, Daddy. I had a couple of martinis at that wonderful new bar, and I didn’t think it’d be a good idea to drive home inebriated, so I spent the night there.” I smile at him.
“I’m glad that you liked it. I wanted you to join us for a family breakfast, so I was about to phone Hunter in case you were with him.”
“No, I wasn’t with Hunter. You wouldn’t get a response from him anyway. You know he’s never up before noon.”
89
“Well, I think it’s important you remain with him. His family is very compatible with ours. Come, Millie and your mother are in the dining room.”
“Daddy, I’m not hungry.” My stomach lurches at the mention of it.
“Maris, I’m not asking you,” he says curtly. “Come along.”
I follow him into the dining room. Mother’s at one end of the eight‑seater table, and Father takes the other. I sit across from Millie who seems only partially conscious, still in her prudish nightgown with her silk sleep mask beside her. She takes a lazy bite out of a croissant and stirs her black coffee. She, like Hunter, doesn’t like to be woken before twelve. Mother is perfectly composed in her white linen dress and the opal necklace she received from her sister in Australia. Her honey eyes show no trace of lethargy, but I see purpling bruises along her arms. The maid’s brought out the intricately designed Wedgwood china, something she only does for Daddy.
“So, what are we celebrating?” I ask, managing to drink some water. Rosa hovers about, pouring coffee I didn’t ask for and handing me a croissant I can’t begin to stomach.
“That’s all for now, Rosa,” says Mother without concern for politeness. “Please go and finish washing the dishes.” She sips her orange juice, which I know has been spiked with Krug. “Maris, take off your sunglasses. You’re inside, it’s obscene.”
My jaw clenches, but I know better than to start an argument while Father’s around. He has a good impression of me, one I intend to keep up, so I can remain in his will. Mother has no power, so she hasn’t earned my respect or servitude. I take my sunglasses off and set them down beside me. I hope the swelling has eased. “Is that better, Mother?”
“People would say you were raised by animals,” she tuts.
Animals would’ve done a better job raising me, but I don’t tell her that. “We couldn’t have that, now could we, Mother dear?”
“Daddy, what’s up? We haven’t had a family breakfast in two months,” says Millie, her voice strained and drowsy. “Please tell
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

me you woke me up early because you plan to surprise me with another Porsche.”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Millicent, you’ve had that car for less than a couple of months and there’re already at least a dozen dents in it.” He glowers at her when she yawns. “What your mother and I wanted to talk about is the expansion of our business. We want to establish hotels in Aspen, Vail, Denver, and Salt Lake City, and that’s going to mean we’ll be gone for quite a bit of time. Normally, I wouldn’t worry. Maris is very responsible, and I trust her to take charge of the home, but with a lunatic running around and kidnapping or murdering young women in this area, we must reconsider. We don’t want either of you to be a target—you’re well known and attractive, and due to the media, most people know where we live and where we are if we’re traveling.”
“Daddy, I don’t think it’s much of an issue, honestly. I’m twenty‑three‑years old, I’m a grown woman. I don’t need to worry about this lunatic. If I were to be a target, I’d have been one already.”
“With all due respect, Maris, your best friend was abducted,” says Mother sharply. “And I know you didn’t seem to care all that much once it happened, why, you went straight up to take a shower and failed to even mention it to us—we had to find out through the news, and it’s been a week without her returning. I think your judgment may be a bit clouded currently. You were at Lake Sam with her—the man who abducted her most likely spotted you too.”
I roll my eyes. “Maybe he has a thing for blondes?”
“See, Henry, do you see what I mean? She’s so insouciant about it. Carol has been her best friend since she was a month old,” screeches my mother. “I told you. She’s either in shock or she doesn’t know how to deal with this. She’s certainly not to be left alone here.”
“Mom, why don’t you hire a babysitter to keep an eye on us?” Millie interrupts. “That always works, right?”
H o ne y traT R A p
91
“Henry, Maris isn’t to be trusted in this situation, and Millicent isn’t anything more than her mouthpiece, I’ve been telling you this all morning.”
“Fuck you, Mom. Honestly, fuck you.” Millie takes a swig from her mug.
“Millie, that language isn’t acceptable here. Do you hear Maris using those words?” My dad cuts into his poached egg, and the oozing makes me want to vomit. “I won’t tolerate vulgarity.”
“How long are you planning on being there?” I ask.
“Well, we expect to do grand openings in early 1975, the earliest being Aspen, so we’d be there for a while. Of course, we’ll fly back to check in and make sure everything is okay here. Another option that I was considering was that you both can come along with us. Millie, you’re not enrolled at college. You shouldn’t have any issue moving to Utah or Colorado for a while.”
“But you know that I’m in medical school. I can’t disappear for a year, can I?” I interject. “I will take care of the hotel and the house here, and you guys can set up what you need to over there.”
“Dad, you make it sound like I’m a loafer. You know that I’ve been hosting charitable functions throughout this year.” Millie’s animated now, energy delivered to her through displaced indignation.
“Oh Millicent, who are you kidding? You’ve spent most of your time in Europe and hosted one gala, which, may I remind you, was planned by your mother and Sophie in PR,” he bites.
“You know I can hold down the fort, I always have,” I say.
“Maris, you’re getting too thin, please eat something,” says my mother.
“Quinn, now’s not the time to discuss her eating habits.” He turns to me. “Look, Maris, I’ve always felt comfortable leaving the reins to you, but with the recent disappearances and murders, I don’t know if it’s safe.”
“We can hire security if you’d like,” I insist.
A year without them would be quite the vacation. Otherwise, I’m always a little concerned that they’ll walk in on me while I’m with a girl or with a guy that’s not Hunter. It’s almost as if they’re
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
92
more concerned about my fidelity than he is. “Like I said, I can’t just quit medical school—you know how difficult it was getting in, and how much I studied and sacrificed.”
“Do you think you could get a transfer?” asks Daddy.
“Of course, but why would I leave UW for a crappy college in Utah or Colorado? You know those schools are for idiots who couldn’t be bothered to study. Instead, they go to keggers and protest the Vietnam War. And I don’t want to offend the Mormons by showing my ankles.”
I can picture myself inviting Jack over for a game of tennis or lazing by the pool with a cigarette and my textbooks, with the entire compound to myself. Granted, there aren’t many days over eighty degrees here, but the swimming pool is heated, and the sun is sharp enough to tan me like a trip to the Mediterranean. My mind travels to Charles, and I feel a hollow thud in my stomach.
“Alright, well, I think we’ll have to compromise. Perhaps your mother can spend more time with you girls, and I can spend more time there.”
“The maids are here, they can serve as nannies,” says Millie. Her sarcasm is thinly veiled. “Why do you want to go to Utah anyway? There’s nothing there.”
“Look, Millicent, I’d take your opinions more seriously if you had a degree in business. Hosting one party doesn’t qualify you to make decisions about a multinational corporation,” says Father. “You should’ve completed your degree and gone on to do an MBA so you could actually help the family rather than hindering it.”
“I’ll tell you what, Dad, why don’t I just run in front of a fucking bus, so you don’t have an extra burden on you, and no more daughters to whinge about.”
Daddy rubs his temples. “Girls, you’re the sole benefactors to Caldwell Hotels—if you want to have nothing to yourselves once we die, that’s up to you. Otherwise, maybe you should be more interested in expansion and development. All I did at your age was work at one menial job after another trying to save up for a better future. You could at least be grateful.”
H o ne y traT R A p
93
“Dad, you inherited this. You weren’t some broke joe slumming it on skid row. You were handed the company. Stop pretending that you weren’t born into privilege,” spits out Millie scathingly.
“Come on now, Millie,” I say. I need to keep Daddy on my side if I want to make it out of this alive. “There’s no need to be rude to Daddy.”
“See, Millicent? Maris has a positive attitude and an aptitude for business, despite her medical goals. She doesn’t spend her time tanning by the pool and drinking gin. She has drive, initiative.”
“No Dad, she’s a brownnosing lesbian who pretends to be ambitious and is waiting for you to die so she never has to work a day in her life.”
I turn to her, resisting the urge to throw my plate at her face. “Yeah, I’ve been in a relationship with a male for over ten years. I’m definitely a homosexual.”
She’s weak and cracks under pressure, so I don’t push too hard. She has too much information on me. There’s also a disturbing resemblance—even most identical twins I know have obvious differences, and she and I have none, facially. If I were to injure her, there’d be a decipherable distinction.
“Hunter’s obviously a front for all your female involvements.”
“Well, I can’t argue with that solid logic, Mill. You caught me, I’m a raging homo.”
“I can’t deal with these girls, Henry, I can’t. I slave away caring for them and all they want to do is rip us to shreds. We’ve worked so hard, so hard, and for what?” adds my mother, with as much indignation she can muster this early in the morning.
“Since you clearly don’t need me, why don’t I go visit some friends in Olympia?” asks Millie, playing with the fruit on her plate. “I’m sure ambitious Maris here can take care of everything.”
“If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were a high school dropout. You can take your resentment elsewhere, Millie. I’m too nauseated to deal with your shit right now,” I snap. “Daddy, you can trust me with this. If it becomes too strenuous, I can try and do night classes instead so that I can man the staff at the hotel. I highly doubt this killer is coming for me, and say, if he does, you
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

know how many hunting rifles we have—I know damn well how to shoot one.”
“You are such beautiful girls, of course you’re going to be targets. Apparently, this deranged individual likes slender women with hair parted in the middle.”
“Just leave it with me, Daddy. I’ll start parting my hair to the side instead. Let Millie go to Olympia.”
“Okay, what I can do is install some more alarms and possibly put in a security guard. I saw a strange boy here earlier, lurking about,” says Father. “I’ve never seen him before. He could be the ‘Ted’ everyone’s looking for. I’ll make sure Will, the deputy sheriff, can drop by to see if everything is alright.”
“What’d he look like?” I ask inquisitively.
“Well, he looked about twenty with blue eyes and dark hair.”
“Isn’t Ted a dirty blonde?”
“Perhaps he’s gone incognito.”
“Daddy, I think you’re being paranoid. You’ve trusted me before, and I haven’t yet let you down even once.” This is a blatant lie, and he gives me a look. A very particular kind of look. He doesn’t say anything about it, though.
“Alright, Maris, well, we’re still here for a little while longer to watch how things are but, yes, I know you’re capable.”
Mother watches me, her affect cold. She attempts to cover up her bruises with her Hermes shawl, but I can still see the purple finger indentations. I can’t remember an occasion when she remained completely intact during Father’s stay. She’s a very proud woman. She’ll never admit that her beatings are frequent and forceful, that sometimes her slender body succumbs to them. She always has a front and an excuse. She ran into the doorknob. She fell down a flight of stairs. She had an accident in her spinning class. The truth is that Father has her deeply under his control. He apologizes after he beats her, gifting her flowers and Cartier necklaces in the hospital. She always believes that he’s genuinely sorry and that he’ll never behave the same way again. She hasn’t told a single person, not her parents, not her friends, and not even us. He used to beat her, and she used to beat us. Now he smacks
H o ne y traT R A p
95
her around, and she doesn’t quite have the stamina to come after me to take out her rage. One time she’d asked him about one of his female subordinate’s lipstick being in his office. He had beat her so severely that she’d had a concussion, two fractured ribs, a broken wrist, bruised thighs and a broken nose. He usually endeavors to avoid her face. She’s very beautiful, and there’re few ways to cover up a damaged face. He’d momentarily lost control that time. I think I was around fifteen. It wasn’t anything new, and I didn’t visit her in the hospital. I waited for her to come home and take it out on Millie and me, but she didn’t. She pulled on her favorite nightgown and robe, sat at the home bar, and poured a tall glass of brandy to wash down several Xanax pills.
My father has never set a violent finger on me. Millie’s taken a couple of beatings, but that’s mainly because he has some strange reasoning—she reminds him of our mother. I don’t. Whenever he was in town, he’d buy me dolls and books, my only two passions as a toddler. When I grew older, he started with more extravagant gifts: a horse (despite me hating animals), a Porsche, Chanel handbags (picked out by his assistants) and access to my trust fund. He’s bought a house in my name—perhaps for the tax break. Millie accuses him of playing favorites, but he constantly denies it. He strongly believes in academics, so Millie never had a chance. She pulled a B+ average through school, and that was far from good enough. His attitude toward Mother has softened of late. Now all he does is shove her around or grab her by her tiny and frail arms. Her fractures have healed, but I doubt much has been achieved in the way of her mental health. Millie fast became her favorite when we hit our teens. My psychiatrist had asked if I felt a certain way about the abuse Mother endures. He knew I’d generally watched it happen, been right there. Honestly, I didn’t feel strongly about it either way. I usually went to my room to watch television. If she couldn’t take care of herself, it was her fault and had little to do with me. Vulnerable people send out an implicit vibe to those around them, giving them the green signal to use them as doormats, and that’s certainly not my problem.

I let the breakfast go on for a while before I excuse myself from the dining room, much to the dismay of my mother who was clearly hoping my father would berate me on her behalf. I need to exercise. It’s a strong part of my daily routine, and not just to look fantastic. I have such a clear mind when I run or swim. I can find targets. I can decide what color to paint my room and what kind of haircut I should be getting soon. I like long‑distance running. Sprinters are far too masculine and as a woman, I could spare the extra muscle. I don’t want bulging thighs and thick calves. I get dressed in my exercise gear—shorts that could double as hot pants, a red sports bra, and a backless Adidas t‑shirt. I still feel a little queasy, but that’s never stopped me before. Our house is on the water, so there’s a nice view around here. Granted, it’s not as beautiful as Colorado or Vermont, but it’ll do. I start with a walk as I leave the front door, my new running shoes squeaking on the freshly mopped floor. I stretch a little before I begin to run. My muscles are tense and sore and I’m overdue for a Swedish massage. I like doing a steady six to nine miles when I’m feeling unwell—when I’m well I opt for twelve miles. I feel it’s a good regimen for staying slim and feminine. It’s also effective should I ever choose to run the half marathon again.
The sun glitters on the water of Lake Sam, now far less crowded than it has been for most of the summer. People are too terrified to go back there, worried that their girlfriends and daughters and wives will disappear into the abyss with no trace of a scream or struggle. The boys and men are emboldened, walking around shirtless with no regard for their safety—only women need leashing, apparently. I get lost in my thoughts once I’m in my comfort zone, the delicious muscle pain traveling through my legs. I look straight through stocky old Mrs. Davenport, only noticing that she’d been waving at me once I’ve passed her. She likes to do her exercise at this time because, usually, no one’s around to see the jiggling fat on her arms and the loose cellulite on her thighs, visible through her Lycra leggings. The divine smell of the river mixed with the scent of the blooming oriental

lilies helps calm me. I run uphill and downhill, fast and slow, to give my body the right kind of exhaustion to keep my mind busy.
When I’m bored, I feel restless and deeply uncomfortable, I can’t give my brain too large a window for thoughts. I like seeing the manses scattered across the vast waterfront. Each house has intricate designs, each tells a story, each holds a family so drastically different from the next. Our house is by far the largest, with a giant gate containing it. The others often take the essence of our house but fall far from recreating it. Ours has a Georgian façade, with a winding driveway and a sandstone finish. The Davenports put in a tennis court after they saw one in our compound when my parents invited them over for dinner. The family is completely geriatric, so I feel it was essentially a waste of time and space, but I like that people want to imitate us.
I often bump into Jack while I’m exercising. He spends most of his time on a banana chair in the front yard of his house reading, and I make sure to say hello as I pass. He is still distraught from Carol’s disappearance—almost to the level of hysterical Mrs. Greene who has posted missing girl flyers all over Seattle. The day maid let me know how many times he’d phoned me and which messages he left. They were unchanging. He misses Carol. He feels responsible for her disappearance and possible demise. He’s terrified about what could’ve happened to her. She could’ve been raped or dismembered, her small body diced into neat little squares in some sicko’s freezer. She’s the absent girl, the vanished girl, the potentially dead girl. He doesn’t want that. He also seems to believe it’s a fine idea to leave these kinds of messages to the house staff.
I clear my throat as I begin to approach his house, but nobody is there. I can see Mrs. Rutherford next door puttering about, tending to her gardenias. I get a little winded as I turn the corner—the cigarettes always have some sort of a side effect. I take a break, catching my breath.
“Maris?” asks a familiar but strange voice. I turn around, rubbing my eyes to ensure it’s not the sun playing tricks on me.

“Charles?” I stand rooted in my position. “What’re you doing here?”
“I was in the neighborhood. I thought I might drop by…” He shakes his head and laughs. “I mean I drove an hour and a half and knocked on everybody’s doors here.”
“Oh my god, you’re the guy my dad thinks is Ted. How many houses did you go to?”
“I think twelve, but a lot of them refused to open the door, so I don’t know if I should be counting them.”
“Jesus, I thought we were a little more important than that. I mean, our house is basically the only one you can see.”
“Well, you wouldn’t give me your phone number, so I had to do a little snooping. Those bats at your hotel wouldn’t give out any of your details, but I remembered that you live in the super upscale part of Bellevue. I figured you couldn’t ignore me if I turned up in person.”
I give him a smug smile. “You know I have several housekeepers, right? Housekeepers whose names I could give over to the immigration department if they fail to listen to my orders?” I feel a single bead of sweat trickling down my chest. I note as his hawk‑eyes follow its descent.
“Look, I thought that might be an issue, but you have to appreciate my effort, right?”
“Are you counting stalking as effort?” I laugh. “Where’s Melissa?”
“She’s back in Ellensburg. She’s at Central Washington State, she’s majoring in psychology.”
“She’s training to become a shrink. Huh. Isn’t she a little too hostile for that?”
“I think she was only that hostile because she caught me staring at you for a goddamn hour and all.”
“Tell her I’m not competition. I’m not a fan of being a homewrecker.”
His sun‑dappled skin and beautiful eyes catch me off guard, but my pride kicks in with full force.

“She’s not competition because she can’t compete. I don’t think many girls can. Of course, Susan Anton and Sharon Tate, but I like brunettes more.” He starts laughing. “Like Raquel Welch.”
“I met her at a benefit for deaf children, she’s a lovely woman, and her figure is impossible to believe,” I boast. Raquel’s photos do her no justice. I’d never been more attracted to a woman.
“Was she nice in person? She sounds so stuck up in all her interviews, a real diva.”
“She’s the sweetest actress I’ve ever met.”
“Yeah, I don’t know why it took me so long to realize who you were.”
“Well, now that you’re here, what is it you want?” I say it firmly, like my stomach isn’t turning in on itself and my chest isn’t struggling for air. “If you’d like to take the penthouse suite, I could probably swing it—my father’s not too hard to deal with.”
“No, Maris, I don’t want to stay at your hotel. I told you I wanted to take you out properly, a meal at the least, maybe in the Space Needle.”
“I appreciate that, but I’d rather not get salmonella again.” I dab at my forehead with the sleeve of my t‑shirt: the heat is overbearing. “I ought to get back to my exercise.” The burn from last night is searing, impossible to ignore. I force myself to respond like a proper human, and not stare like I would otherwise.
“I know this is only the second time I’ve met you, but I really like you. I wish I could have control over it. Trust me, I’m not the kind of guy who drives to another city, knocks on random people’s houses, and ambushes a pretty girl during her run.”
“It didn’t seem that way yesterday, Charles. Perhaps it’s best you stay with Melissa,” I say through gritted teeth, desperate to defy my body’s intentions. “I need to get my run in today. I have a photo shoot coming up, and I can’t afford to look chubby.”
“I don’t think it’s possible for you to look chubby. You could get blown away with a gust of good old Seattle wind.”
“Tell Jantzen Swimwear that.”

“Are you not interested in me?” He’s pleading now. He tries to make me look directly at him, face him, and say no. He knows I can’t do that.
“Okay, Charles. Here’s the deal. You’ll come and pick me up tomorrow night at seven for dinner. It won’t be at the Space Needle because we’re not fat, middle‑aged tourists from the Midwest. There’s a nice French place a bit down from here, Larousse, it’s got excellent food and then you’ll be more than welcome to enjoy a film at my place. How does that sound to you?”
“It sounds like this entire stalking thing was worth it.” He smiles, flashing his perfect teeth.
“I live at 4900. I think you should go back to Ellensburg right now before my dad phones the police about the handsome, dark‑haired boy skulking about the neighborhood looking for his next victims.”
“Handsome, huh? I’ll take that.” He beams. “Isn’t that Ted guy a blonde?”
“Yes, but I don’t think my dad quite seems to understand that.”
He kisses me before I can complain about being too sweaty to touch him.
“I’ll see you tomorrow, then, Caldwell.”
I grin, easing back into a slow jog. “I’m looking forward to it, Charles. I’m sorry, I didn’t get a chance to learn your last name.”
“It’s Elderberry. Shitty, I know.”
“That’s cute. Well, I’ll catch you then.”
My body is whirring with excitement and energy after he returns to his car. I channel it all into my running, forcing my body to race uphill five more times before continuing along the lake. I push myself to my limits as frequently as I can, making up for the junk I eat from time to time. I need to keep myself in a size four to pull off the bare midriff and hot pants look. My nausea has worsened, but I keep going, taking a loop around Redmond before heading back to my house.
My legs ache and my chest burns by the time I get to my front gate. I head inside, knowing no one will be around to turn

on the security gates—usually you have to be buzzed into the compound. I throw my gym clothes into the laundry and pull on a no‑frills, one‑piece swimsuit. It’s exclusively used in my home as I wouldn’t be caught dead in it outside. I head to the pool with a towel, tossing it onto one of the chaise longues. The cold water shocks me for a moment once I dive in. I resurface for air and wait for my body to acclimatize. I always do twenty laps in the pool after a run: five backstrokes, five freestyles, five breaststrokes, and five minutes of treading water in the ten-foot end. That’s the highest calorie burn of them all. It helps to cool off and tone the muscles comfortably. I’ve never been much of a fan of weights or other gym stuff. I mean, I’m not a man, and I’m certainly not butch, so this is my main cardio and weight outlet. I like to be thoroughly exhausted once I’m done. I have too much energy, and I can’t handle it. I need to get rid of it in any way I can, preferably through a rush, but I do settle for exercise. I splash around in the pool for a little while after I’m done, partially because I’ve gone temporarily blind from the industrial dose of chlorine the pool boy has put in, and partially because I’m still reeling. I don’t use goggles as frequently as I should. I feel utmost serenity when I slip into the shower, tilting my head back to let the water pour down my face and through my hair. My legs struggle to hold me, but I’m calm in the scent of the body wash and the visible cloud of steam. I think about Charles and his wholesome all‑American beauty for longer than I should. I towel dry myself and walk naked into my bedroom, thankfully locked. I sort through my lingerie collection and put on a black silk mini-negligee. I wear the matching silk thong and put on a robe for respectability. I moisturize my skin and put on some lip balm before I phone Lilith and ask her to come over.
* * *
I meet Lilith in the foyer. My parents are out, and I don’t know where Millie is. The night housekeeper is busy vacuuming the family cinema room. Lilith’s radiant. She’s exactly my height, and K anikaANI K A B AT R A

her skin is clear, smooth, dark. She’s got striking green eyes and a willowy figure, with tousled short hair. I give her a hug, running my hands down her slim, bare back. Her dimples are endearing, but I can’t get past the sexual pull of her perfectly shaped lips.
“Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” I say softly into her ear, pulling her closer.
“You always know the right thing to say,” she replies, brushing my hair back before she kisses me. “And the right thing to wear.” She looks me up and down and grins.
I grab her by the arm and lead her up the staircase to my room. It’s not as if she doesn’t know the way by heart, but my fear of lack of control is taking over.
“I brought some party favors,” she says, pulling out a baggie of ketamine from her purse. I leave the door unlocked when we’re upstairs. I always like a little bit of danger, perhaps my mother walking in on me and the girl she takes out to dinner with us because she’s one of my “best friends” from childhood.
“Thank fucking god for that.” I take it from her and sort lines on my dresser drawer. I ingest a quarter of the bag, an amount that’ll make me sick tomorrow. She stands behind me, her arms tightly holding me to her by the waist. I turn my head over my shoulder and kiss her, my hand on her cheek. I feel her against me, the heat of her indulgent body. I turn around to face her, and she pushes me against the wall as she kisses along my neck. With Heather, I feel comfort, security. With Lilith, I feel unfettered carnal bliss. She’s very similar to me. She’s neither heterosexual nor homosexual but an equal opportunist. I don’t care about the sex of the person I’m fucking as long as I climax. I’m motivated by the almost instant gratification sex can provide me, and while I don’t want to boast, I know my skills are great too.
She slides her hand up under my nightgown, running her fingers against my skin. I throw her onto the bed and straddle her, using my teeth to pull off her halter top. I pin her arms down and kiss her eagerly, on the mouth and then on her chest with frenzied force. I feel her mouth on my shoulder and her warm breath radiating down.
H o ne y traT R A p
103
“You are so gorgeous,” I tell her as I unbutton her skirt. I take it off slowly, relishing every second of her lust‑filled agony. I kiss her flat stomach and then the insides of her thighs, touching her chest and the small of her back. I take off her underwear and go down on her. She shivers as I start gently, using the tip of my tongue to trace her neat, beautiful vulva.
Now, I’m no feminist. I don’t think all pussies are wonderful looking and created equally. Some look horribly messy and hairy, but hers looks like the gate to heaven, perfectly formed and wonderful to touch. She tastes sweet, very sweet, like water when you’re parched. I slip my finger into her, and she moans and writhes as I synchronize it with my mouth. I love eating her out; I love her legs around me. I keep going until she climaxes and then go harder, rougher, using two fingers this time. She convulses exquisitely and then goes limp, her breath ragged. When she regains her strength, she holds me close and kisses me as she takes off my nightgown, allowing the luxurious fabric to drag across my chest, leaving me covered in goose bumps. Her lips caress my breasts and my waist, and I feel her lightly bite me on the hip. She looks up to grin at me before she starts. She’s usually rather dominant through sheer experience. She knows what to do and when to do it, and it’s so sexy to see her so cavalier about it. She goes down on me with the finesse I know Hunter will never learn, no matter how hard he tries. Her fingers feel incredible. I hold her in place with my thighs and sigh in pleasure when she brings me to orgasm. She kisses me, and I taste myself on her mouth. I kiss her harder, savoring every moment of it. She rubs against me in the missionary position, simultaneously fucking me with her fingers until I’m spent.
We spend most of the night laying in each other’s arms, naked except for the silk sheets between us. I try to keep myself quiet, defying the urge to scream in pleasure. I hold my hand over her mouth when she starts getting too loud in case someone’s nearby. My parents don’t tend to spend too much time on my floor but, recently, with Millie claiming I’m a homosexual, I don’t doubt they may plan to drop in to catch me when I’m in a compromising K anikaANI K A B AT R A

position. Lilith and I don’t have the energy to speak, but I hold her until daylight hits. Her body blossoms with the sunrise, the beams highlighting her perfectly curved hips and slender legs. It doesn’t take long for my eyelids to feel heavy as the ketamine loses control and sleep takes over.
“I love you, Maris,” she tells me drowsily as she drifts off.

CHAPTER EIGHT
I’m ravenous by noon. I rub my eyes lazily and throw on a loose t‑shirt to get food downstairs. Lilith left before I woke, leaving a note bearing only an imprint of her red lipstick kiss. She must’ve snuck out while everyone was distracted. Maybe she told Mother that we had a lot of catching up to do. I feel far less groggy than I expected and pour myself a giant bowl of cornflakes and milk.
I sit in the lounge room and eat while watching a replay of the morning news. Another girl has disappeared. She’s beautiful, with long, straight hair parted in the middle, looking disturbingly like Carol. Her tearful father talks about how wonderful she is, how vivacious and kind and friendly. Do they ever say that the person was a bitch? That no one liked her, and she was rude to neighbors and cheated on her boyfriends? That she kicked small animals with pleasure as a kid? Surely, they all can’t be saints. I know this for a fact. The males I disposed of all have advocates talking about how upstanding they were, how they honored everyone around them when in reality they were little bitches who selfishly wanted to fuck an attractive woman whether they were single or not. If they didn’t exude vulnerability, arrogance, and sleaziness, they’d probably still be alive. I only became a master through their idiocy.
“They found human female remains near Lake Sammamish,” says Millie as she strolls in. “Two skulls.”
“Did either belong to Carol?”
106
“I don’t know, they haven’t identified them. They need dental records. Her mother’s over there causing a scene, though, because one of the skulls had hair that looked like Carol’s attached to it.”
“Where’s Mother?”
“She’s gone down there to support Mrs. Greene. She wanted me to tell you to meet her. The area’s been cordoned off.”
“Fuck, I’m too tired. Can’t you go? She was your friend too,” I say mid‑yawn. I scoop as many cornflakes into one spoonful as I can. “I wasn’t the only friend who knew her, and who knows? It could be someone else. You know how dramatic Mrs. Greene is being.”
“They’re fairly confident that they belong to the missing girls from Lake Sam a while ago.”
“Mill, do you have a cigarette on you?”
“You know we’re not supposed to smoke, especially not inside,” she tells me coldly.
“What’s your fucking problem?”
“You don’t even care about Carol.”
“Of course I care about Carol. She’s a dear friend of mine. She’s also a good friend of yours, so I’m wondering why you aren’t there?”
“You’re fucked up. I mean what we do to those boys is different. She’s been your friend since we were born. You should care.” Her tone is judgmental, accusatory.
“Can you cool it? I just woke up. I don’t have enough energy to be so emotional this early. I think you need to either calm down or go there and help them dig at Taylor Mountain since you seem so invested.”
“I never mentioned a location, Maris.”
I don’t react physically, but I feel a jolt. “You said it was close to Lake Sam. There aren’t that many places around there to hide a skull other than Taylor Mountain,” I respond, seamlessly covering my tracks.
“Finish your breakfast so we can drive over there. At least pretend to be concerned.”

“Fine—go and bring me jeans and shoes from my room. Make sure they don’t look like shit with this t‑shirt.”
“Okay,” she acquiesces. “I’ll choose something for you.”
“Make it quick, alright? I have a date later today.”
“With whom?”
“I don’t think that’s any of your concern.”
She’s visibly upset but says nothing, leaving the room as quickly and silently as she appeared. Usually, I tell her most things, but she needs to be put in her place considering her attitude this morning. We’re close, very close, but sometimes she’s so irritating. She gets on her high horse, pretending she doesn’t do the exact same things I do.
The telephone rings, but I don’t answer it. I figure it’s my father waiting to berate me. Millie brings me a pair of bellbottoms and camel‑colored suede platforms. I put them on, tucking in my t‑shirt. Normally, I wouldn’t dress like such trash, but I have neither the inclination nor energy to go upstairs myself.
“You’re driving,” I tell her through my last mouthful of cereal. Mother isn’t around to scold me for talking with food in my mouth. I grab a pair of sunglasses from the kitchen counter, Mother’s I presume, and follow Millie out the door.
“Can I have a cigarette now, Mom?” I ask her acerbically. She hands me a single cigarette from her pocket and lights it for me with my lighter. I don’t know how she has it. She drives joltingly, and I come to understand why there’re scratches and bumps all over the car.
“Are you going on a date with the girl you had over last night? Lilith or whatever her name is, the Negro?”
“You know, Millie, you really fucked me up yesterday by telling everyone I’m a lesbian. I’m not even gay. I don’t need Mother and Father on my back, alright?”
“What did you expect me to say? Dad’s always on your side. He loves anything you do and thinks I’m useless. I thought, maybe, if he knew what you were like, he wouldn’t do that anymore. You fucked a girl last night. How can you deny it? I heard her screaming for dear life.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
108
“I fuck women and I fuck men too. That’s unusual for homosexuals. You understand what homo means, right? You just want your name on the inheritance instead of mine. You know how much they hate queers.”
“Well, I don’t think it’s fair that you’re the sole heir to the company.”
“Maybe you should take that up with them instead of lying about me to make me seem like a pervert. You could earn it instead of whinging like a little bitch.”
“Oh, fuck you, Maris.”
“You’re a parasitic leech, Mill. You should at least go to university instead of being at home all day doing nothing.”
“That’s rich coming from you.”
“I study medicine. I help Father with executive decisions. That’s hardly like you.”
“You also have an extensive juvenile record that Dad had to pay a lot of money to expunge.”
“You realize that records are automatically expunged when you’re eighteen, right? It’s not like you have a blank slate, either, not even in adulthood. I don’t think I’ve ever had a DUI, which I don’t think you could say for yourself.”
She rolls her eyes and pauses at a stop sign. I take a long drag of my cigarette, the ash burning up rather quickly. It’s gotten chilly out, and I regret not bringing a cardigan—Seattle is probably the worst place to enjoy summer, other than England. We get about a week of heat a year. I’ve spent time in Tanzania, India, Australia, and New York, so I know what a real summer feels like. I realize we’re getting close to the site when I see a stream of people trickling out into the street, gathering. They’re held back by armed policemen and crime scene tape, and many of the women are crying, probably wondering if their daughters have been slaughtered and crudely dumped there. It takes me about three seconds to spot Mrs. Greene. She’s sobbing maniacally, and she’s wrapped her hair up into a towel turban like she’s just gotten out of a shower, which I suspect might be the case. Mother is beside her, rubbing her shoulder to comfort her.

“Oh shit, how on earth am I going to get parking here?” asks Millie, thinking aloud.
“Well, I wasn’t the one dumb enough to want to come here at this time, Millicent,” I say tersely. “I’ll get out and let them know we’re here. You should find some back street for parking.”
“Don’t gloat, Maris. Tell Mom I’ll be there shortly.”
I jump out of the car and rush to my mother and Mrs. Greene. “Oh Mother, Mrs. Greene, I’m so sorry I’m late. Millie slept in and didn’t want to come, but I was horrified when I saw on the news that human remains had been found. I couldn’t sit idly by if my dear Carol were here. I was beside myself! Please, Mrs. Greene, don’t cry.”
“Maris, dear, I’m glad you’ve arrived,” says my mother. She clutches her Tahitian pearls, the same black as her dress and shawl. Her hair is perfectly coiffed into a beehive, held in place by a small Jackie Kennedy‑esque hat. She hugs me briefly, and I force a hug upon Mrs. Greene. I see her look at me in contempt, wondering why I’m still here and her daughter isn’t. It’s making me rather uncomfortable, and I wish she’d stop. I can see one of the skulls, even from all the way back here. Investigators are scouring on hands and knees, their shoulders barely an inch apart. The crowd is upset, angry. They confront the police as if they’re responsible for the crimes. They want somebody to blame, somebody they can use to ease their pain and loss. They’re worried for their children. They think their daughters may be the next to disappear.
“Please tell me that’s not my beautiful daughter,” sobs Mrs. Greene to a handsome, barely legal cop who stands with his arms crossed over his chest.
“I’ve told you a dozen times, ma’am, we won’t know until we can match dental records to the skulls.”
“Well, it can’t be my Carol. My Carol could never be reduced to a skull,” she insists to herself with tears streaming down her face, slipping past wrinkles and red patches.
“Oh sweetheart, please, we don’t know anything yet,” says my mother pacifyingly, in her sweetest voice. “Don’t stress, Elaine, they’re doing everything they can.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
110
“Please, Mrs. Greene, it’ll be fine,” I say, avoiding her disturbing stare.
“You don’t know that. You don’t know shit. None of you did anything to help her.” There’s only rage in her voice.
“We didn’t know she was in trouble, Mrs. Greene. She’s my best friend, I love her, and I miss her. I wish it’d been me instead of her, I really do.”
“Elaine, you know Maris would’ve gone out of her way to help Carol. They’ve been thick as thieves since they were a day old,” Mother says, almost indignantly.
“If my daughter hadn’t gone out with these kids, she would’ve been fine. She would’ve pulled up to the house in her Camaro and watched television with me like we did every night. Now I can’t sleep, I can’t eat, I can’t move.” Sobs convulse through her body with every word.
“Honey, they’re all good kids. We thought they were safe; they always have been. They’re not responsible for this atrocity.”
I can see her holding back anger, smoothing it out with diplomacy. When Millie finally joins us, I’m sure she can tell what Mother is thinking by her posture alone.
“Oh Mrs. Greene, please don’t cry,” she says automatically. My mother puts up a hand to signal her to stop speaking.
Mrs. Greene lours at Millie too. Another daughter to spare. Another beautiful girl with hair parted in the middle and doe eyes. “I don’t know how to cope, Quinn, I don’t.” She leans into my mother, whose lifelong lack of a maternal drop of blood somehow seems not to matter. “You have your lovely girls, both of them. I don’t have mine.” She breaks down in my mother’s arms.
“There’s a good chance that you do have her. She may not be the one whose remains have been found. You can’t lose hope, alright? I simply won’t let you.” Mother cuddles her and soothes her like she never did us. “You’ll come home to our place if you feel sad or lonely, we’re always here for you, Elaine, always.”
“I just want my baby.”
“I want my little Carol too. She’s so sweet, she lights up our house whenever she’s there,” says Mother. She’s holding Mrs. H o ne y traT R A p
111
Greene, rocking her gently like a child. “Can I get you anything, Elaine? I have my car. I can bring you some coffee or tea or a sandwich.”
“No, I haven’t any appetite. I can’t breathe. My baby is gone.”
“You don’t know that,” says Millie.
“A mother knows.”
It starts to drizzle, the water quickly dampening my white t‑shirt. Luckily, I didn’t take my bra off last night with Lilith. It makes Mrs. Greene more anxious, her grip on my arm strong enough to snap my bone in two. She watches the detectives obsessively, noting each of their slight movements and screaming whenever they stumble upon something, whether it be leaves, a rotting rat or a couple of rocks. The detectives become frustrated, shooting her dirty looks. She refuses to move. She flatly declines when they offer to drive her home. She stands in the rain with icy determination. “I’m going to be here as long as you are,” she tells the detective resolutely. She has no plans to back down.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, ma’am, you’re hindering our investigation. We won’t be getting any results for at least a week.”
“How would you feel if that was potentially YOUR daughter’s skull?” she screams.
“I don’t think that’s necessary, ma’am,” he says hesitantly. I see him looking at her, particularly weary. I can only imagine how annoying she’s been up until this point. She’s frustrating at the best of times.
“Oh girls, you’ll catch a cold, didn’t you think to bring a sweater?” asks Mother as she wraps her shawl tighter around herself.
“It’s summer, Mother,” I tell her, trying not to shiver.
“My sweater is in the car,” says Millie. She watches Mrs. Greene. I don’t know if she feels the hostility and envy I do.
“Elaine, do you think it may be better to come to our home and wait for news inside? You’ll get drenched out here, and you need your rest. It’s been an extremely tough couple of weeks.”
“Yes, Mrs. Greene, you can come and stay with us,” I offer. I don’t want her in our house. I need serenity when I decide what to K anikaANI K A B AT R A

wear to see Charles. I also don’t want to be stopped from leaving, which Mother sometimes does if we have family friends over. In this emergency situation, there would be no chance of me leaving.
“I’m staying here as long as the police do, Quinn.”
“Alright, well, I’m staying right here with you.”
“As will I, Mrs. Greene,” I add unctuously. Maybe it’ll lessen her creepy vibes.
The police work tirelessly, but I know how inefficient they are. Even if you leave goddamn clues right in front of their offices to taunt them, they’ll still fail to figure anything out. They could’ve probably found the girls if they hung around this area during the week after the disappearances. Killers generally come back to the crime scene. Once you do a good job you want to savor it before disposing of evidence.
I’m surprised at the rate of decomposition, though. It’s not hot enough for the girls’ flesh to disintegrate this fast, not even with the presence of rodents and insects. I suspect the skull belongs to someone else, but Carol’s can’t be too far away. I spotted her body when I was here dismembering one of the males. It was mostly intact, and it seems medically impossible for it to be in this state already. She was nude and maggots were feasting on her abdomen. There was both putrefaction and decomposition, but there was more flesh on than off. I’m sure he planned to decapitate her as he did the others, but when I saw her last, her head was fixed on her body. I thought about leaving once I saw her body, but I knew that important work had to be done so that the male couldn’t be identified once he was eventually found. Even if her killer did walk in on me at his special crime scene, I had enough weapons on me to protect myself. I had more to lose by leaving. Plus, I kind of enjoyed the thrill and danger of it all.
“I’m sure Carol will be alright,” I add. I smile at her gaunt mother, placing my hand on her arm. “There’s no need to stress at the moment.”
“I wish I could be as delusional as you,” she snaps.
“I’m being optimistic, Mrs. Greene. Carol is my best friend.”

She ignores me, only to stare at the cop, imploring him to help her with her pain. He doesn’t. He stands there in silence, watching as the diggers sift through what’s become mud. The rain grows heavy, the dark clouds threatening a storm. The crowd thins, leaving only us and parents of a few missing girls. Mrs. Greene is still choking on her sobs and hiccupping loudly. Mother looks around in distress, deeply uncomfortable, and clearly wanting to leave. How would she do so without looking selfish, though? She knows she has to stay, but there may be water stains on her Hermes pocketbook and that’s not a risk she’s ever willing to take.
“Oh dear, I’m feeling a little dizzy. My blood sugar must’ve dropped,” she says, attempting to be clever.
“Go home, Quinn. I’ll be alright.”
“No, I couldn’t leave you here alone. Don’t be silly.”
“Look, Maris, take your mother home. She’s not well.”
“Mother, let’s get you home and something to eat. I don’t want you fainting again like you did last week.”
My mother does not have diabetes, but I want to get out of the rain. I want to go home and decide on an outfit. I’m tired and need my rest a lot more than I need Mrs. Greene’s obsessive stare. For a boy as beautiful as Charles, some effort has to be put in, not just the lip balm and eyeshadow I wear for Hunter. I have a dozen dresses that would make him forget Melissa’s existence.
I had court‑mandated sessions with my psychiatrist until I was eighteen. My parents forced me to continue them into my adulthood, thinking that they could cure whatever was wrong with me. They could never pinpoint what it was, but they tried their best, attempting to stifle any urges I may have had. It didn’t help, I just learned to lie better. My mother was the worst; she would fill my father with lies about me, ensuring I couldn’t miss a single appointment if I wanted to keep my inheritance. She wanted an explanation. She couldn’t understand how she could produce such an internally defective product in a beautiful body.
She has always been proud of how attractive Millie and I are. She actively encouraged everyone to comment on our beauty K anikaANI K A B AT R A
114
from the age of three. I guess she thought it reflected badly upon her. If her daughters were beautiful, she would have to be as well. We were her trophies. It’s what made her harsher on me. She didn’t want my behavior to reflect poorly on her. I started pretty early. It would have to be blamed on her and Father’s genetics and the environment they raised me in. I was always bored and restless as a child, and I had to find an outlet.
There was a puppy that used to sneak into our chalet whenever we were in Colorado—I don’t know which breed, but it was little and garrulous. I think I was perhaps six or seven, and I’d always despised animals. I found them curious, these little creatures that we slaved over. My mother loved dogs, especially the fluffy, little thing that always found its way inside. I fucking hated that dog; it would wake me up at five with its incessant barks. I let it into my room and closed the door as I went to the kitchen. My mother had a set of collectors’ butcher knives because she told my father she had a passion for cooking. I took two of the larger ones back into my room. Everyone was still asleep—I could hear the nanny’s deep, rumbling snores. The dog started barking again. I kept looking at it, wondering what to do. I wasn’t hesitant when I picked up one of the knives. I wanted to see how it would react. I held the dog tightly between my thighs and severed one of its ears with all the force in my body. Blood started rushing down my white bunny‑patterned pajamas. It started screaming like a human child. I went for the second ear. It frantically tried to free itself from my grip but failed. It trembled and cried, and I didn’t know if it was having a seizure. The noise was enough to wake the family.
Mother rushed to my room, and I was temporarily distracted. The dog jumped from my lap and started running in panicky circles. It took Mother a couple of seconds to realize what was happening. Her eyes were wide and horrified. The ears were next to me, dropping blood onto my quilt.
“Are you insane?” she asked me with a strained quietness, gathering herself. “ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?”
“No.”

“What on earth are you doing, you sick little monster?” She made an effort to soothe the puppy. “HENRY, PLEASE COME HERE,” she screamed in her shrillest voice, the sound reverberating off the walls.
“I wanted to see what it would do,” I explained to my father who had hurriedly put on his smoking robe, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes.
“Oh my lord,” he whispered in disbelief.
The dog was still screaming and crying. The knife was still in my hand. I felt a strange sort of rush through my body. Father took the knife from me, and Mother slapped me so hard I can still feel it. I lost my allowance for a month, and my mother was hysterical around me for the same amount of time, calling me deranged and depraved at every opportunity. Of course, no one outside the four of us knew. They couldn’t have the media find out about their deviant daughter, despite the amount of rage they had for me. The next dog I experimented on was in complete seclusion, and that time I put it out of its misery, slitting it open from the jaw to the bottom end of its stomach. It wasn’t a criminal offense but, even if it were, my parents would never have reported me, despite how much my mother loved dogs. She found the carcass a few days after, rotting and covered in maggots.
“She’s very beautiful, but there’s something wrong with her,” was all she could say for years about me. “There’s something missing. She doesn’t have any humanity in her,” she would tell my father. “Look at her eyes. They’re so lovely, but they’re so empty. She looks right through you.”
I didn’t take heed of any of it. I knew there was nothing wrong with me. I knew I had an intellect she couldn’t understand. She was never on my level, and she never will be, as is the case with most other people. I eventually lost my fascination with animals. I knew what they were going to do, how they were going to react. It wasn’t interesting anymore, and my mind wandered. I tried to control it, I did. I wanted to get into medicine, and I wouldn’t be able to do that if I were a deviant. I did all I could to stop myself.

I was a late bloomer, but Hunter and I got together when I was about thirteen. I was flat‑chested and flat‑hipped like a boy. My parents encouraged the relationship, even though I was barely an adolescent. He came over one night, and we watched The Moon is Blue—some wild movie made the year after I was born. He pressed his body to mine, cuddling me well into the film. He grew hard against my thigh, and he pulled my skirt up, prying my legs apart painfully. He climbed on top of me and forced himself inside me as I tried to fight him off. He was larger and stronger. I had no chance. The loss of control hurt more than my aching body. It was more offensive than the blood trickling down my thighs. Of course, he thought it was what I wanted, and he was incredibly proud of himself. He bragged to the boys at his school. After all, he was the only almost thirteen-year-old who’d nailed a girl—and not just any girl.
I was filled with rage, and I had no real outlet. I saw a little boy walking past our house alone during the summer of 1964. He looked about ten or eleven and stood at the front edge of our property, gazing down at the sparkling view of the sun beating down on the lake. I was on our front lawn, tanning myself on one of the five days of summer. My mother was away, visiting her parents in London, and Millie was with a couple of her friends. I called the boy over to me, asked him what he was doing. He was a little apprehensive at first, but I managed to talk him into coming to the house. He was very interested in the view and the pretty sailboats. I told him the view was better upstairs, that he could see almost all of Seattle. It was rare for me to be in Washington at that time. Usually, we’d summer in East Hampton. He followed me inside on my command. I led him into the spacious attic‑come‑gym. It was, and still is, a stunning room. The ceiling is mostly made of glass, as are the walls. My methods were messy and uncontrolled back then. After all, I was just entering my teenage years. I couldn’t be as sophisticated or trained. I was a child. He was a child, younger but the same size. It was a fair fight. While he was looking out at the water, I rendered
H o ne y traT R A p

him unconscious with a crowbar. I tied his arms together with a skipping rope while he was out cold, and when he eventually came to, I walloped him, focusing all my anger and boredom on his slender body. He wasn’t great to look at, but I didn’t care all that much back then. I didn’t have standards for attractiveness.
I couldn’t control myself as I beat him with anything I could grab. I smacked him again and again with the crowbar on the head, on the torso, on the legs. I could hear parts of him cracking and blood seeped into the flooring. He was still very much alive, and when he tried to scream, I shoved my sock into his mouth. I left bruises on every inch of his skin and beat him relentlessly about the face until he was unrecognizable. I knew I’d broken every facial bone. I wanted to see how much a human could take. I wondered how different it would be from the dogs. I didn’t expect it to be as exciting as it was. I sodomized him with a glass bottle of Coke, and he screamed through the sock as he thrashed about in agony. The smell was truly awful. I’m telling you, it was pure hell. He’d defecated himself. I didn’t know that happened as a person died.
I was going to set him free by slitting his throat from ear to ear but, instead, I sat silently with him as his body gave way. I think it was an hour until he finally died. I’d never felt as powerful. I never knew something could feel so phenomenal. I left his body there and went down to shower. I ate a packet of chips and drank some lemonade. Only then did the panic set in. I had no idea what to do with his body. With animals it was easy, I could dump them into shrubbery and ignore any missing child posters. With a boy, I imagined people would start looking for him eventually or that he’d end up on a billboard on the freeway. Kids from our area appeared in the media quickly. It was the one negative of being wealthy.
I left the body upstairs for a couple of days, hoping that no one would find it. Mother hadn’t used the gym even once after the initial week of its purchase. I didn’t think there would be any risk. I was a smart kid. I knew it would start stinking, but I’d planned to remove body by then. It was very messy, far messier than I’d
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
118
expected—his head was barely connected to his body, and he weighed a ton. There were splatters of congealed blood on the windows, and there were shit and urine on the floor. I thought I’d done a pretty good job. I scrubbed at the bloodstains until they were gone and used latex gloves while I mopped around the body. His face was bloated and battered, the eyes swollen shut. It only got uglier as time progressed. I hadn’t planned it. I never meant to actually kill him, but when it happened, I realized how relaxed I felt for once, not restless, not bored, not in pain.
I prefaced a conversation with Millie with a pithy excuse, telling her he tried to steal from me. The smell had begun to radiate from the top floor. I warned her it was a messy scene. But I needed her up there. It was impossible for me to throw out the body alone. I wanted to wrap his body in one of the rugs, but most of ours were Oriental and as expensive as the house. I remember how upset Millie was when she saw his ravaged corpse. She inevitably started sobbing, and I think she was a little traumatized. She kept telling me I had no right to kill him for stealing from me. She was much slower than I was back at that age, so I claimed that the wounds I had from the stabbing struggle were from him attacking me first. “He hurt me, Millie. He had a weapon on him. He said he wanted to come up and look at the sailboats. Look, just look, I have so many injuries from him,” I insisted, showing her the gaping wounds on my hands. I started crying for effect. She ran to the bathroom to vomit. I watched as she heaved over the toilet bowl and held her hair back with one hand.
“You’re going to have to help me get rid of him. You love me, don’t you? You know I can’t do this alone. He assaulted me, Millie, I didn’t instigate. I did whatever I could to protect myself,” I said with primed tears.
“I can’t—I can’t help you with this. You killed someone,” she said with the stutter she wouldn’t lose until she turned fourteen.
“Would you’ve rather had him kill me? He was going to. I had to fight to save myself,” I urged.
H o ne y traT R A p
119
“Maybe we should ask Mom or Dad what to do. I don’t want to touch it,” she cried. “I can’t touch that thing, I’ll vomit again. It stinks so bad in here. What are you going to do when his parents come looking for him?”
“Millie, haven’t I always helped you? I gave you my hundred dollars last month so you could finally have that trainset you wanted. Who else would do that for you? How can you abandon your sister like this?”
“Just tell Dad. He loves you, I’m sure he can help you.”
“No, you know I can’t do that.”
“Well, if he attacked you first, it was…okay to do this…wasn’t it?” She struggled to catch her breath. “I’m going to get Dad. He can fix it. He can always fix it.”
She was right, I knew that. He could help me, but I didn’t want him to think any less of me. I didn’t want him to think I was this aberrant excuse for a child. He always knew what to do to get us out of a situation, but I didn’t know if it would be worth the cost.
“Okay, bring Daddy,” I said quietly as I braced myself. “Make sure Mother doesn’t come up too.”
“Just wait here, alright?”
“Yeah, just go.”
I paced back and forth as she tried to find our father downstairs. He could only be in his home office, the den, or his bedroom. I had no idea what was taking her so long. Every excruciating minute felt like an hour. When I heard them on the steps, I felt my body freeze. Father surveyed the damage silently, stationary. Those two voiceless minutes seemed like an hour.
“Did anyone see him coming into our home?” he asked me, showing no sign of emotion.
“No, I don’t think so. There wasn’t anybody around.”
“Have you told anyone other than Millie?”
“No, Daddy,” I told him solemnly.
He wasn’t frenetic like my mother. He acted based on rationality, not emotions. He was level‑headed, like me. He used to tell me stories of his boyhood when he would do the same things I was doing.

“Millie, why don’t you go help your mother set the table?” He was calm, collected. He put his arm around her shoulders as she sobbed. She agreed eventually and left after promising not to say a thing until he told her it was okay.
“Okay, Maris, I don’t know why you’re behaving like this,” he told me. “But I will try and fix things. You need to tell me what happened.”
“Do you want the sugar‑coated version?” I asked him boldly.
“No. I want you to tell me why and how you did this.”
“Daddy, I’m really sorry.”
“I don’t care about all that, what fucking happened?”
I’d never heard him swear before. He always claimed to be above that kind of vulgarity. It shocked me a little, despite the context. “This kid was outside looking out at the sailboats at Lake Sam. I was, I don’t know, upset. I told him to come inside because we had a better view. I don’t know why it happened. I knocked him out cold and then kept beating him, over and over, and the next thing I knew, he wasn’t breathing. I don’t know, I didn’t expect that to happen. I didn’t think I could be strong enough to hurt anyone, let alone, you know, kill someone.”
“Why did you tell Millicent?”
“I needed help.”
“She’s hysterical like your mother. Did you think that would be wise?”
“I couldn’t drag this body out by myself. I can barely even carry shopping bags.”
“What were you planning on doing with it?”
“I don’t know, I was thinking maybe I’d dump it out in the wooded area.”
“And then what? You’d get caught, Maris. You’d get caught in thirty minutes flat. You wouldn’t have a future.”
“I don’t know what to do.” I began crying.
“Stop that nonsense. We need to figure this out,” he barked irritably. He rubbed his temples as he strode about. My father hates crying or any form of weakness. “You’ve really done a number on this one.”
H o ne y traT R A p
121
“I was angry.”
“Couldn’t you have taken it out on another neighborhood poodle?”
“I told you, I’m sorry, what can I do?”
“You’re doing nothing at all—I have to handle this.”
He stood quietly, thinking. I could almost see the mental calculations as if he’d done this before. It was a long while before he spoke again, and I sat on the floor, my back against the bloodstained window. I stopped the tears now that they were no longer necessary. The body was disgusting to look at, but I couldn’t look away.
“Alright, Maris, I’m going to make a few phone calls and see what can be done considering the mess we’re in—both literally and figuratively. You know the maids clean up here, right? Did you think about that?”
“I’ve kept them away so far, haven’t I?”
“If you talk to me like that, I’ll have you thrown in jail myself,” he says coldly. “Go downstairs and eat your dinner while I fix your mistakes.”
He wasn’t someone whose buttons I’d push, so I shut up pretty quickly and went downstairs. He made his phone calls and struck a deal with some political and judicial heavyweights, ensuring I would never see the inside of a juvenile correction facility or deal with a criminal record as long as I attended court‑mandated therapy sessions with a criminal psychiatrist on a weekly basis. I don’t know what he did with the body, but I learned two things: firstly, the boy was from a lower‑class ethnic ghetto—not our neighborhood as I assumed, and secondly, that I very much enjoyed killing.

CHAPTER NINE
I rake through my extensive wardrobe multiple times. I go through Millie’s clothes too. I’ve shortlisted four dresses that are worthy of tonight’s affair. Charles isn’t from an affluent town, but he deserves more consideration than Hunter and the other men I’ve dated, purely because of his beauty—I feel overall that’s worth more than money. My monetary sources are plentiful. I eventually decide on a beautiful navy‑blue, bell‑sleeved dress. It has a deep neckline that shows the right amount of cleavage, and, paired with the heels I’ve chosen, it elongates my legs. I shower and then moisturize my entire body, leaving myself smooth and soft. I spend a fair amount of time applying makeup. I use shimmer shadow, mascara, and this bronzing powder that’s always confused the hell out of me. My lip gloss is shiny and clear, tinged with wintergreen and ginger to emphasize the fullness of my lips. I leave my hair down and take a classic brown Yves Saint Laurent pocketbook with me.
Charles greets me at the door with a smile, and I feel that twinge in my stomach again. I don’t let on my excitement.
“You look wonderful, Maris.” He kisses me on the cheek.
I glance around quickly to make sure my family isn’t in the vicinity before grinning back at him. He’s incredible in his suit and tie, conveniently also navy blue.
“Okay, my old rambler isn’t quite as fancy as your Porsche, but I hope it’ll do.”
123
“We all have to make compromises sometimes,” I tease him. “I’m glad this time you didn’t knock on all our neighbors’ doors. My father was getting seriously concerned.”
“This time I was aware you lived in the fanciest house within the fanciest neighborhood.”
“Well, you’ll be inside later. You can tell me if it really is the fanciest.”
“I can’t believe you guys don’t just live in your hotels,” he says to me incredulously.
“When you’re in as many hotels as I’m in, you want to be in a house, to be honest. I sometimes want to hurl when I see a lobby.”
“You should see my apartment in Ellensburg, you’ll be hurling for a while.” He laughs.
“I’d love to go see your place over there. Get me out of here.”
He gallantly opens my door for me. It’s cute watching him fumble for the right moves as he aims to understand how dating works. I don’t think Hunter has opened a door for me in about five years. His charm now only appears when he’s in the company of those who’ve known him for less than twenty‑four hours.
The drive to Larousse is approximately ten minutes. It’s handy having excellent French food so close by. My taste is a little eclectic. I usually love trashy junk food, but Larousse’s fine dining offers some serious competition.
“I’ve never had French food. Is it really snails and stuff?” He turns to face me, ignoring the road in front.
“All snails, nothing but snails—they’re slimy and delicious.”
“Maybe I’ll stick to a side salad,” he says wearily. “Just in case you aren’t joking…”
“Oh, well, that’s no good, there’re snails in that too.”
“Maris, I’m going to kill you. I’m the one driving,” he says, amused. “I’m not going to be able to pronounce anything, and I’ll be eating snails.”
“Okay, why don’t you let me do the ordering for you?” I glance up. “Oh, turn left here, the valet can handle parking the car.”
“Do you want the valet to see you in this piece of shit?”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
124
“Well, he’s seen me in my sister’s battered Porsche, so how much worse can it be? Luckily, my company doesn’t look as bad as the car,” I tell him. “And Lorenzo isn’t that much of a dick because he isn’t actually French.”
“You’re on a first‑name basis with the valet guy? Aren’t you a woman of the people.”
“If you keep talking to me like that, I’m not going to put this on my parents’ account.”
With the way he’s driving, I’m not sure how we even made it to the restaurant. “You drive like a fucking grandmother, by the way. Not my grandmother because she drives over ten an hour but definitely a geriatric,” I add.
“Well, maybe I want to delay the slimy side salad.” He maneuvers the car into the little spot in view of the valet stall. I smile at him, running my hand up his thigh as we roll to a stop. Color flushes his cheeks, and he freezes, eventually scrambling for the keys to give over to the waiting and joyful Lorenzo.
“How are you? You’re looking wonderful!” I say, still working my fingers along Charles’s leg as I speak to Lorenzo, who is wildly out of place working at a French restaurant. “Come on, Charles.”
“Oh, Miss Caldwell, I’m so glad to see you. Where is your lovely mother?” He leans down into the driver’s side window.
“She’s at a rave with a lot of MDMA, Lorenzo.” I start laughing. “No, she’s at home, but I’m sure she’ll drop in sometime soon.”
Mother won’t ever be dropping in, considering her perpetual diet and her feverish fear of butter and carbohydrates. We only have a tab here because my father brought her in once during a family meal and then continued to frequent the restaurant with all the blonde twentysomething girls he hired as our staff. He’s always been the stereotypical attractive businessman and has had more affairs than he or anyone can remember. He takes the hidden, most intimate booth, thinking that might spare him if Mother were to casually waltz into her dietary nightmare.
The maître d’ is a frazzled Frenchman I’ve never seen before. He’s taking reservations on the phone while arranging a table for us. He eyes me up and down.
