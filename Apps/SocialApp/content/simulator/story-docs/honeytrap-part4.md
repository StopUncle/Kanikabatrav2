He was considering it, thinking it through in front of me. He didn’t need a façade anymore. There was nothing to hide. He had two options: take my word for it, knowing how much I had to risk also, or execute a possible witness. It would’ve been impossible for him to miss the corpse of my doing. He was too skilled to not stake out the area. He would’ve known the hunting ground as well as I did.
“You’ve seen what I’ve done,” I said. I gestured to the general area of where I’d discarded the body. “You know what would happen to me if I said anything.” I reached for the back of my jeans anyway, just in case, my hands slow. He had no weapon on him, so I wasn’t in direct danger, but I wasn’t stupid enough not to recognize his ability to overpower me in a flash with his size. His legs were far more muscular than his corduroys cared to reveal. His arms were almost twice the size of mine. He was male; I was female. It wasn’t a fair fight without a weapon or time on my side. I knew better than to be visibly panicked. “I’d incriminate myself. I don’t want to be in prison.”
“Do you know her?” He’d tilted his head toward Carol. “There are photos of both of you together in the newspaper.”
“She’s not important enough to risk incarceration.” I was firm, believing it wholeheartedly. I loved Carol, but I wouldn’t love dying or being thrown in jail. Her decomposing corpse made me want to heave, but her life wasn’t as important as mine. “No one will know. I’m pushing for someone else to be made culpable.”
“You know I’ll find you if you try to do anything. You’re the famous girl, getting to you won’t be difficult,” he’d sneered. His tone was as bitter and resentful as it was snide. He was pretending to be repulsed by it, to make a mockery of my position in society because he knew it was far above his, far above anything he could aspire to. It was then that my disgust kicked in. I had naturally what he craved and struggled for. I grew up in mansions and hotels. His low rent, middle‑class family could only afford cheap cars and secondhand clothing. He could change the way he dressed, the way he styled his hair, and the manner in which he spoke, but he could never change his poor breeding and lack

of pedigree. He had less value than the dirt at the bottom of my heels. His clipped accent could only give him so much. He begrudged his upbringing and took it out on the people he so desperately wanted to be in with or those he believed were easy targets. I found that pathetic. The victims he has sought over the past few months have all been petite women, lacking the physical ability to fight back. Women are smaller, more delicate, and easily overpowered. It wasn’t a show of masculinity to subdue a human a foot shorter and fifty pounds lighter: it was cowardice. His ego was as fragile as their bodies.
“I believe you, Ted. I have nothing to gain.” I’d said it through clenched teeth to avoid laughing, he wouldn’t appreciate being mocked. No male does. “You could kill me, or I could go to jail. Only two options here.”
“How do you know my name?”
I could’ve sworn it’d been another minute since he’d blinked. “You told me your name at Lake Sam. I was your target before you got to Carol.” I was emboldened by the gun and lack of sleep. “You were going to take me up to Issaquah to get your sailboat. I assume this is what you actually had in mind.”
“The things I would’ve done to you,” he’d said, stepping toward me. “Or the first time, the weekend before.”
I stepped back toward the safety of my car, but I could feel myself filling with rage. “If you know who I am, you know who my parents are. You’re lucky you picked the wrong girl, or there’d be a lot more heat on you from the police, not to mention the media. Missing heiresses get a lot of airtime. People care.”
“Well, aren’t you a princess.”
“No. I’m just not common,” I said. “My absence would be noticed, trust me. I’m worth more to you alive than dead.”
“A trustworthy woman.” He tilted his head back and laughed a real loud belly laugh. “That’s rare.”
“Almost as rare as an intelligent man.” I knew I was pushing it. It felt like a mask slipping, but it was comfortable, not unnerving. It wasn’t that I was among peers—he wasn’t what I’d call an equal, but there was a side to me that I couldn’t reveal to others, one I
H o ne y traT R A p
205
felt was easy to share with him. “You won’t hurt me; it’d be a silly strategy. It’s something I’d expect from a normal man, but you’re not normal, are you? Most guys like their women alive. Physically, at least.”
“You’ve got a mouth on you, that’s for sure.” He was somewhere between livid and bemused, not knowing exactly what to do with himself.
“I’ll leave you alone, Ted, but I know I’ll see you around. Maybe we should get a drink together.” I’d swelled with confidence by that point, obscene and obnoxious, even by my standards. I climbed into my car before he could respond, but he was left there just as he first noticed my presence, dumbfounded and mouth agape. The engine roared to life and I fled. I was annoyed that I was unable to finish my work, but it was safer to be there when he wasn’t. I found Carol’s decaying body a little bit of a downer too.
“Maris, are you alive in there?” Hunter’s voice brings me back into the present. Realizing his thoughtlessness, he puts his hand over his mouth in concern. He sees me staring at Ted. “Do you know that guy?”
“Yes, he works at the crime prevention society. He’s lovely. I should go say hello. He mentioned Carol in their latest bulletin.”
He grabs me by the elbow. “Why are you always looking for a reason to get away from me?”
“Why don’t you stop being a little whiny bitch? Come with me if you like,” I snap. “That way, you might quit the paranoia.”
I feel a sharp blow to my cheekbone, the pain searing as I fall to the ground. I look up and realize he’s smacked me. The shock hits him when it hits me. I hear people rush, clicking heels on the marble floor. Hands on my arms, a set on my waist, lifting me up.
“How dare you touch her,” Mother screeches. She’s echoed by Millie and Stephen. Ted is the one that brings me to my feet. The sting of humiliation is beyond me. I feel myself trembling.
“I’m so sorry, Maris. I didn’t mean to—”
“To hit me or to be seen doing it?” I stare at him, nauseated. My cheek throbs and tears of rage threaten to stream down my
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
206
face. I want to rip off his limbs one by one, douse him in gasoline and set him alight. This kind of indignity in public is unbearable, more so than any physical injury. “You don’t feel satisfied enough hurting me and those poor girls in privacy?”
“What are you talking about?”
“You know what I’m talking about.” I scream, “It’s why we’re here!” I gesture at the space. I feel the wheels churning in my mind. Maybe Stephen’s not the right guy for this. Maybe it’s the one standing in front of me, hand red from striking his gentle, vulnerable girlfriend.
“I think you should leave. It’s never right to hit a woman.” It’s Ted’s distinct voice. It’s still amusing despite my burning face.
“This man’s right,” says my mother. She’s firm, her voice cold. “You should leave, Hunter. I don’t want to have to call security on you.”
“Mrs. Caldwell, I’m sorry, it was a mistake. I don’t know what happened.”
“You attacked my daughter. That’s what happened. I need you to leave.”
“I didn’t mean to…I’m so sorry. I just…”
“Please leave.” She steps toward him as if she were about to usher him out with force far beyond the capacity of her five feet and eighty pounds.
“I haven’t done anything like this before, I’m sorry,” he says frantically. He’s on the verge of tears, but no one shows him sympathy. Nobody should.
Hunter walks out, and I deflect the negative attention. I’ll play the victim if I must, but I don’t enjoy it. I smile at the onlookers to let them know I’ll be alright, waiting for them to turn back to their drinks. Strong women don’t gain much trust or sympathy. Everybody loves a damsel in distress. Vulnerability in women is second only to physical beauty in desirable traits. I wait it out a few moments, wiping a tear from my cheek, and then escape to the bathrooms. A line trails from the ladies’ room.
“Say, Maris, what about that drink you wanted to get?”
H o ne y traT R A p
207
Without turning to face him, I know it’s Ted. I don’t think it’ll be easy for him to harm me in this setting, despite how adeptly he abducted two women from a police‑infested lake amidst a crowd of 14,000 Seattleites. I’m too significant.
“I’d love one, Ted. Which did you have in mind?”
“You look like a martini girl.”
“Excellent guess. What tipped you off?”
“You’re a classic beauty. Classic beauties are traditional.”
“You’re not wrong.” I smile, letting him lead me to the bar. I’m bombarded with large images of Carol’s face on banners around the room. I wonder if it’s exciting him. She, too, was, in his words, a classic beauty.
His smile is warm, but it doesn’t reach his eyes that stare through me, lifeless and disconnected. Unblinking. Maybe mine are like that too. I know mine are a better shade of blue, though.
“Sit,” he says, pulling out an oak chair for me. I do, not shifting my gaze from his hands. I’d rather not be roofied. “A martini and a double scotch on the rocks,” he tells the bartender.
“I see why you weren’t so fixed on the boyfriend idea,” he says to me.
“Well, that makes one person I know. My parents are gaga over him. Maybe that display will change their feelings.” I glance over at Mother, now happily chatting to a society lady. “Then again, maybe not.”
“Parents are useless anyway. Don’t worry about them.”
“Now Ted, that’s what I always say. We sure do have a lot in common.” He sees me look up at Carol’s ten‑foot face.
“You’re very relaxed about everything.”
“Why wouldn’t I be? I’m sure the authorities are out there looking for the monster who hurt Carol. Maybe it’s the guy who smacked his girlfriend in public.” I take the martini from the bartender and have a sip.
He maintains eye contact and has a self‑satisfied little smirk going on. “You’re right. I hope they find that monster.”
“He sure looks like that sketch, doesn’t he?”
“Identical.” He clinks his glass against mine.

CHAPTER FOURTEEN
“What do you think about getting out of here and finding somewhere private to talk,” says Ted, slurring his words after gulping down his fourth scotch. “Maybe smoke some reefer.”
“Listen, Ted, I’m interested, but I’m not an idiot.” I speak low enough for the nosy bartender to not hear. “Carol and I aren’t too different. I don’t have any more strength than she does. Well, did.”
“Do you think something’s going to happen to you?”
“Maybe.” I neglect to tell him about the weapons I have access to and how swiftly people would intervene to save me. “Imagine you were me. What would you be thinking?”
“I’d like the challenge.”
“I have responsibilities here. I have to make a speech. How about I get you a key to the penthouse, and I’ll meet you there in an hour. I don’t have any weed, but I have plenty of alcohol.”
“I have my girlfriend Beth here. I’ll have to get rid of her.”
“That mousy little brunette? Really? Come on, Theodore.”
He laughs. “Theodore? That’s bold of you.”
“Is that not your name? Theodore Robert Bundy. Ted for short. It was bold going by your real name.”
“Nice one, Nancy Drew. Or do you prefer Maris Cordelia Caldwell? Maris for short. Unless you’ve managed to come up with a nickname because I, for the life of me, cannot figure one out for a name like that. How did your parents even come up with it?”
209
“The Virgin Mary, or short for Stella Maris. Jesus, don’t you understand biblical mythology?”
“You do seem like a very holy girl, Maris,” he scoffs. “Was knowing my name your trump card?”
“Damn, you sure caught me.”
“And Millicent. Where did your parents get that from?”
“Still more creative than Linda and Glenn. I forget the rest. It’s like a clown car if you know what I mean. Are you sure you guys aren’t Catholic?”
“You really do have a mouth on you.” He drains the last of the scotch. I think at this point he’s gulping air. His gaze is directly on my chest. “I’ll get rid of Beth.”
“I’ll meet you at the lifts in an hour. Oh, and Ted, I’m never late. I hear you aren’t either.”
“See you in an hour. If you’re not too afraid.” He gives me a nod as he weaves through the crowd to find his insipid girlfriend. I see him in my mind, his hands around Carol’s throat, her eyes devoid of light, and her body torn apart. I try to picture myself in her situation, but I can’t. I’d never be a victim. Some people are born to suffer, and I’m not one of them.
I take the stage to applause, much of the crowd having witnessed me being assaulted by my boyfriend, thus amply softened. The burn of indignation is soothed by the compliance of the audience. I spout the same nonsense I’ve repeated a dozen times since the incident. It’s become a script, well‑rehearsed, well performed. Carol’s unhinged mother is crying, dressed in a ratty, worn peach and gold gown that washes her out. Mother’s watching me. The expression on her face could be mistaken for compassion to those who don’t know any better. To the trained eye, it’s contempt and humiliation. I should take my beatings in silence like her; it’s less shameful. Unlike her, though, I won’t roll over. I exit, down a flute of champagne, and head for the elevator when fewer eyes are upon me. I shirk out of Mother’s cold grasp on my way.

He’s waiting for me, as promised. His hair has been re‑coiffed, his suit fits perfectly, and his black patent leather shoes are gleaming.
“I can see why the girls are dying for you to take them out,” I tell him, laughing at my own joke. I ought to be ashamed.
“You’re a clever girl,” he says dryly.
“I have to be. I’m not exactly funny, am I? I’ve got to have something going for me.” I half expect him to lunge at me with a homemade shiv.
“You’re attractive, that’s all a woman needs.”
I neglect to tell him that his IQ would be about thirty points lower than mine and his life savings would amount to less than what I have in a purse at any one given point. Males aren’t worth the effort of discussion: they don’t have the intellect. Maybe they’re defective or something, I don’t know. I don’t bother. “Let’s go upstairs.” I take his hand. His palms are slippery with sweat. Maybe he’s more nervous than I am. I ignore the hammering in my chest. He glances down at our entwined hands, perplexed.
The elevator dings, and I lead him into the lush expanse of the penthouse. “I think we should talk, Ted.” I dump some ice into a tumbler and pour scotch over it, sliding it across the counter to him. “Here. Drink.”
“You don’t need to get me drunk to talk,” he says.
“Why didn’t you take me instead, Ted? You let me escape. I know you were targeting me.”
“You think very highly of yourself, don’t you, Maris? How would Carol feel knowing you think she was second best?”
“I don’t care about how she’d feel. It’s acknowledging a fact. You approached me first. You lingered when I told you I had a boyfriend. If the timeline was right, and I know it to be, it took you another thirty minutes to secure Carol, and she’s not a particularly difficult person to catch.”
“I can’t get into that right now. You can believe what you like.” He takes a sip, settling into a soft burgundy wingchair. My control wanes, and I’m pulled onto his lap, my legs draped over the arm of the couch. I look into his pretty, hollow eyes and
H o ne y traT R A p
211
then lower my gaze to his mouth. I watch as his hands travel behind me, cradling my neck. I kiss him or he kisses me. I feel sick but not enough to stop. His lips are gentle, and his finger traces my collarbone, making me shiver. “Ted, we shouldn’t,” I tell him, not believing my own words. He doesn’t either. He kisses my neck and my body trembles. I ease him out of his tuxedo jacket, pressing myself against his sinewy frame. The dress feels claustrophobic, the layers trapping heat, despite the coolness of the silken fabric. I keep it on, though. I haven’t completely lost my mind yet.
“I’ll say you’re more beautiful, but that’s all you’ll get from me. I’m not a fan of blondes. You’re more my type.”
“I was Miss Washington USA in ’72. I would’ve won Miss USA if I hadn’t needed to buckle down for med school. I’m everyone’s type.”
He eyes me, unblinking, like when he was on the prowl at Lake Sam. “I can tell.”
I lean into him, running my fingers through his hair. “I’ve been trying to save you. Everyone that’s, uh, disappeared, can be tied back to a friend of mine, Stephen Winthrop.”
“Why would you do that for me?” He pulls back a little, but his hand now rests on my thigh.
“You’re like me. It’s rare.” I neglect to mention that it gets me out of a bind, too, but I know he’d be aware. Men aren’t as bright as women, but it’s clear he’s canny. Men are prime suspects; often, their biological samples from haphazard sexual attacks tarnish their victims. That’s not something I have to fear as a woman. Maybe one day in the future they’ll study vaginal fluids as well as they do semen, but I think that’s quite far from current reality. Plus, which obese pig shoveling donuts into his mouth faster than the speed of light is going to have the foresight to suspect a delicate co‑ed over the bogeyman?
“I’m not like you.” He picks me up and lays me down on the pristine bed. He kneels over me. I feel the panic rise inside my chest as he watches me. He’s easy to read. I know what he’s
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
212
thinking: he has the advantage. The more fearful I get, the more he’ll get off. I try to stare back without wavering.
“Is this turning you on, Ted?” I lay still, even when he releases my arms, showing no struggle.
“Take off your dress,” he orders. His face is only inches from mine.
“What’s the point of you being here if I have to do that myself? Don’t tell me you like to watch.”
“You know I do more than watch. How many pieces did they find of Carol?” He laughs. “She was fun.”
“She wouldn’t be better than me.”
“You don’t serve the same purpose. It’s not a comparison I can make.”
“What’s my purpose, then?”
“Again, I can’t get into that in any detail right now.” He unzips me. The dress slips off, the extravagant lingerie doesn’t. He takes in the image for a full minute or two.
“Am I not good enough for her—their fate?” I press. I stop his hand as it snakes behind me, making a sloppy, drunken unhooking of my three rung La Perla bra clasp. “Am I not better than your mousy girlfriend?”
“Maris, I don’t want you that way. You don’t understand. You won’t.” He withdraws from me. “You’re a fucking princess. You’re picture‑perfect, delicate, untouchable. Made for that guy with the trust fund and multibillion dollar business in his grasp. Not for me. I couldn’t fit in your world, just like I couldn’t fit in Diane’s.”
“You’re kidding me, right? You’re in my room right now, why would I bother if you were beneath me?” The sting of humiliation hits again when he starts rebuttoning his shirt. I reach for him, but he dodges my hand. Hot tears begin to well, seeping down my face one at a time as I close my eyes. I crumple on the bed. His disdain does little to comfort me. Maybe it’s this fucking penthouse suite. First Charles, now Ted: two lower‑class males. I don’t know why it hits me so hard. I need them to want me. It physically hurts when they don’t, no matter how much I try
H o ne y traT R A p
213
to rationalize it. “Get the fuck out, then, leave. Go or I’ll have security throw you out,” I screech.
He contains his rage as he combs his hair back into place.
I make myself a dry martini, using a chilled glass from the mini‑fridge in the suite—one part vermouth, four parts gin. I guzzle it down, wiping my face with a hand towel. I know I’m drunk, but I have a level of mental clarity that would usually serve me well. I get dressed, touching up my makeup in the bathroom. Four minutes past 1 AM, the party would’ve well and truly disbanded by now, all the sympathy for the shattered lives packed into town cars and BMWs hurtling back toward the safety of Bellevue. I stay out of eyeline of the hotel security cameras, almost scaling the back wall to get down the fire escape. I hail a taxi back to the house, which is, unfortunately, still lit up. I brace myself on the long path to the door. I’m greeted by Millie’s lackluster smile as she steps back to let me in. A small mug of hot cocoa in one hand and swaddled in a thick Merino robe, she looks like she’s a minute away from falling into a benzo‑induced stupor. She’ll be of no use to me.
“What happened to you?” she asks, probably seeing my puffy eyes.
“Nothing, move, I want to take a shower.” My shoulder collides with hers as I push through.
“You disappeared for like, five hours,” she tells me indignantly, rubbing her shoulder. “Where the hell did you go?”
I ignore her and take the stairs two at a time. Pangs of hunger gnaw at my stomach as I sit on the edge of the tub, turning on the bathwater. I dip my feet in as it fills, letting the scorching water burn my soles. Any kind of pain to distract myself from the humiliation is helpful. The rage and embarrassment weigh me down, and I want to scream. I scrub my skin raw with soap, wanting to throw the gown into the bin. I twist my hair into a makeshift updo so that it doesn’t get wet. I won’t have time to sit around drying it. I rid my body of any remnants of tonight and wrap myself with a towel. I dress quickly. A cowl-neck K anikaANI K A B AT R A
214
t‑shirt and a leather miniskirt with platforms and baby blue eyeshadow.
“Fuck off, Millie,” I say, seeing her figure in the doorframe as I try to exit. “I don’t have time for you right now.”
“What’s wrong, Maris?” She seems genuinely concerned.
“Seriously, Millie, ask me one more time, and I’ll put your head through the wall.” I walk past her, grabbing my car keys from the hook. I make my way to my car and toss my Balenciaga purse into the back. I drive to the only place I know will be populated at this time. The Velvet Elvis is a university nightclub that’s never short of pretty boys trying to woo coeds till all hours of the night. I park a block away and my feet ache, but I’m restless. The first all‑American blonde guy with a nice smile in my path is about to have the time of his life. It doesn’t take very long to spot him. Sitting at the bar with a rum and coke in hand, gleaming white teeth, and the kind of hair that Clairol can’t compete with. Slightly drunk and very attractive, still in his senses.
“Please tell me you’re here alone,” he says with a southern drawl. He pats the barstool next to him.
“I could be,” I tell him with a grin. I slide into the seat with ease. My senses are heightened, and the familiar warmth rushes through me. “What’s your name?”
“Eddie Salinger, what’s yours, sugar?”
“Any relation to Jerome?” My sarcasm is finely veiled.
“Chicks love asking that. No, no one in my family wrote The Catcher in the Rye.” He rolls his eyes. Hazel, I think, with brown flecks. “I’m sorry.”
“Not even Franny and Zooey then, I’m assuming. That’s a shame. You ought to buy me a drink to make up for the inconvenience.”
He’s taken aback and laughs. “Sure darlin’, what’re you having?”
I flag down the bartender. “A daiquiri please. Extra lime.”
“And you, sir?” he asks of Eddie.
“I’m fine for now, bud, thanks.”
“You seem like a bit of a lightweight.” I gesture at his full glass.
H o ne y traT R A p
215
“Darlin’, I could drink Bukowski under the table.”
His drawl is getting old, as are his tired literary references. It’s time for another funeral.
“Listen, I don’t mean to be too forward or anything, it’s just not like me, but I’m new to town, and I don’t know anyone here…I just moved into a nice little place near Issaquah, I think you should come and check it out.”
He processes it and nods. Confused but clearly interested. “Sure thing, I haven’t explored Issaquah yet either. I don’t know how I’d get back to the city, though.”
“I’ll drop you off, no problem.” I smile into my glass as I take a sip. “You might be worth the DUI.”
“You’ve sold me. Are you sure you’re new to town? I swear I’ve seen you somewhere.”
“I doubt it unless you’ve been to New York recently. I only moved here for college. I used to model.”
“Must’ve seen you on television then, I’ve never been to the Big Apple.”
“You’re missing out. This place has been pretty boring so far.”
“You’ve been hanging out with the wrong people then.” He tilts his head back and drains his glass. “let’s go.”
“Perfect.” I take one more sip of my daiquiri and grab his hand. I take a quick look around to see if anyone’s watching us, but it doesn’t seem like anyone is. I’m beyond caring at this point, I feel the acute rage and humiliation bubbling up inside me, ready to erupt. Most eyewitness testimony falls through in trials anyway. I lead him to the Porsche, and he starts gushing about it; it’s his dream car, apparently. He climbs in at the same time as me. “Oh shit, I’m a little drunk, could you get those?” I ask after dropping the keys on his side. When he leans over for them, I reach for the crowbar in the back and smash it into his head. He keels, and I do his seatbelt up for him. The blow is to the back of his skull, so the blood will seep into the seat, but at least the wound will be hidden should I get randomly stopped by a rogue policeman. I drive him to the cottage and drag his unconscious body inside—it’s more difficult than I anticipated: he’s heavier
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
216
than he looks. I handcuff him to the railing in the bathroom. He doesn’t seem to be rousing, so I fill a cup with cold water and splash it on his face. He jolts awake, groggy and disoriented.
“Where am I?” he asks when he’s finally able to string some words together.
“Issaquah.”
His arm struggles when he realizes that he’s cuffed. “What the fuck is this?”
“Darlin’, I’m trying to spice things up a little,” I say in his hideous southern drawl. “Am I hanging out with the right people yet?”
“I don’t understand,” he babbles. “I thought—”
“You thought you were going to get laid. You were very confident about it.”
“Listen, girlie, I didn’t mean to offend you. I’m sorry, let me go and I’ll drop it, I’ll never mention this happened.”
“You didn’t offend me, I thought we could have a little fun together.”
“What do you mean? Please, just uncuff me.”
I pull the revolver from the vanity “Now why would I do that?” I shoot his left thigh. His scream is so loud and shrill that it reverberates in my head. “Sorry, you’re a large dude, I need to incapacitate you, so you don’t do anything silly.” I shoot his other thigh and perch myself on the edge of the tub.
“I’m begging you, let me go. I won’t tell anybody. Nobody will know.”
“You’ll run right to the cops.” I laugh, then glance down at his bleeding legs. “Oh, well I suppose running’s out of the picture for a while.”
“I won’t tell the police.”
“No, you won’t,” I agree. I walk to the kitchen and pull my favorite knife out of the butcher’s block. When I return, I show it to Eddie. “This’ll make sure you’re not able to speak at all.”
“Please,” he sobs, tears dribbling. “I’ll do anything.”
Ted’s face flashes in my mind, the hot prod of indignity burning itself into my memory. The suite, Hunter’s hand striking
H o ne y traT R A p
217
me, Charles pulling away. Using all my strength, I stab the knife into the male’s chest, twisting it until the nerves sever. I pull it out and go again, this time in the sinewy shoulder. He’s screeching in agony, and I force the knife into the gunshot wound on his thigh. I run the blade down the length of his body, cutting only gently before driving it into his abdomen. I play around with it, pulling it out and shoving it back in. His cries give me serenity, the anger slowly trickling out of me. I slap him repeatedly across the face and then gouge out his right eye. His speech becomes slurred, and I see his limbs going limp. I wring his neck, my fingers crushing his throat with such force that it almost collapses. I suffocate him until he’s unconscious, then wait for him to come back to me. The look of terror in his remaining eye gives me a thrill. I leave him in the bathroom and wash my hands to make a peanut butter and banana sandwich. I switch on the TV and settle for Little House on the Prairie.
Just as the show wraps up, I polish off the last of my food and go back to the bathroom. He’s still alive, barely. Not feeling as much anger, I decide to put him out of his misery. I slit his throat and let him bleed out peacefully into death. I take the ring from his forefinger and slip it into the pocket of my skirt. Gone with my rage is my energy. Just looking at the gore is exhausting. The scrubbing that’ll need to be done to get his blood off the floor and walls is something that I wouldn’t even want to put our Hispanic maids through. I scrub with a rag and some Clorox, only managing to get the tub clean. It’s nearing 5 AM, and my eyes are bleary with sleep, for once not aided by benzos or dolls. I go to the bed, turn down the sheets and slip in, pulling my t‑shirt (now splattered bright red) off over my head. I nestle into the pillow, my last view the skulls surrounding me.
It’s gloomy and gray when I wake up, true to Seattle’s reputation. I glance over at the bedside clock—2 PM. I haven’t had this long of a sleep since I was fifteen. I feel refreshed and at ease, a sense of comfort settling into me, unfamiliar but warm. There’s minimal food in this house. It’s not livable, per se. I find what I can K anikaANI K A B AT R A

from the wardrobe and get dressed in a loose‑fitting green tunic. I brush my teeth in the kitchen, avoiding glancing at the carnage in the bathroom. I assess the car for damage—less than I thought. Other than a damp, dark spot in the passenger seat, it’s relatively clean. I drive past a Hardee’s and pick up a cheeseburger with fries and a strawberry shake. I wolf the food down, satiating my hunger. I love Hardee’s. So much value for seventy‑nine cents. I drive the familiar highway back to Bellevue, listening to Paul Anka. I pull into the winding driveway, not surprised when Mother appears at the door in less than a millisecond, prepared. I’m a little disturbed when she opens her arms to me.
“Maris, sweetheart, are you alright?” Her concern seems genuine but confusing.
“I’m fine, Mother. Why?”
“You’ve been gone for the better part of a day. Listen, sweetie, there’s someone here to see you. I know you’re angry. I am, too, but everyone makes mistakes.” She grabs my arm, pulling me in. I know who it is before I even look past her into the foyer.
“Hello, Hunter,” I say coolly. I sip on the last of the strawberry milkshake. “How can I help you? Do you want the other side of my face this time?”
“Maris, I’m so sorry. Please. You have to forgive me.” He looks like he’s about to cry.
“I have to go work out. I think you should leave.”
“Please, Maris, listen to me. I’m asking for a minute of your time.”
“You’ve had five. Go home, Hunter.”
“No, I want to make things right. I don’t want you to hate me. It was a mistake. I’ll always regret it. I can’t believe it happened.”
“Hunter, go home. When I’m ready to talk, I’ll call you.”
“Maris.” My mother’s voice is stern. “Talk to Hunter. Take him to your room and talk to him. He deserves the benefit of the doubt. He has been your boyfriend since you were ten.”
I glare at the dumb bitch. While she may be moronic enough to believe my father when he tells her it won’t happen again after each beating, I’m not.

“You win, Hunter. You can assault me, and my mother still thinks I should be speaking to you. Come on in, maybe I’ll get another slap or two,” I say, my voice harsh. I turn to my Judas mother. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you? It’ll remind you of your fond times with Daddy.”
Her face is pinched when I turn my back to her. Hunter follows me up the stairs in silence. In my room, he breaks. He kneels at my feet, wrapping his arms around my hips, his face burrowed into my thighs. “I’m sorry, Maris. I’m so sorry. You have to believe me.”
“Alright, relax. Just get up.” By this point he ought to know when I’m lying, but he doesn’t. He lifts up my tunic and starts kissing my legs and my stomach, his hands working their way across my body. His distress appears honest as he clings to me, almost sobbing.
He stands up, now towering over me. I look up to him. “It’s alright, Hunter, we all make mistakes.” I curl my arms around him, burying my face in his chest. I take Eddie’s ring and slip it into Hunter’s side pocket. “I’m tired. I’ll call you later, alright?”
“So, you’ll forgive me?”
“Maybe. I don’t know. Give me a day to think about it. You’re always suffocating me. You never give me space.”
“I love you so much, and you ignore me. You treat me like shit in front of everyone. It’s hard, Maris. You’ve always been the girl I knew I’d marry.”
“Do you think that’s the way to get me to marry you? To beat me and humiliate me in public? I can endure what you put me through in private, but this was outrageous. I thought even you would be above it.”
“It was the biggest mistake I’ve made in my life. You’re everything to me, Maris. I love you. I’ll do anything to make up for it, to be a better boyfriend and eventual husband,” he tells me theatrically.
My leg is in prime position to knee him in the crotch, but I control myself. I level my voice. “Hunter, I have a lot of studying
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
220
to do. Can you go home so I can have a little time to myself? I will call you.”
“Please let me stay, just for a few hours.”
The phone in my room starts ringing, and my mother screams up at me from the base of the staircase to tell me it’s for me, but she doesn’t recognize the voice. I hold my finger up to Hunter to silence him and pick up the receiver. The other side is slightly muffled and unclear. I hear my mother hang up once I say hello.
“Maris.”
My face grows hot. “How did you get my number?”
“It wasn’t particularly difficult. You should hire better staff. Are you alone?”
“No.”
“I want to speak to you in person. Meet me at Mama Barone’s tonight at seven.” It’s not a question.
“Alright. Goodbye.” I place the phone back in its cradle, trying not to grimace at the thought of the greasy Italian fare. I turn to Hunter before he gets a chance to answer. “It was a reporter. I don’t know how he got my number.” I shrug. He wouldn’t know Ted anyway.
“Where was he calling from?”
“KPLZ radio station. One of the chicks used to work there. The ski reporter or something.”
“What did he want from you?”
“God, I don’t know, Hunter! He asked if I wanted to comment on this bullshit.” I turn to the window, my face in my hands.
“Hey, come here.” He hugs me from behind. “It’s alright.”
“I love you, Hunter,” I tell him instead of letting him know how much I’d like to pour gasoline on him and set him on fire or cut off his leg and feed it to him. “I need to get some stuff done. Why don’t we go to Le Cirque tonight for a late dinner around nine?”
“Okay, fine. Can you wear that little black miniskirt I love?”
“Sure, of course. Thanks for being so understanding. I’m really tired right now.” I turn to him, reach up on my toes and
H o ne y traT R A p
221
peck him on his unnervingly smooth, chap‑free lips. “Have you been using my ChapStick?”
He grins. “No, I bought some. It’s flavorless.” He’s very proud of himself, like a six‑year‑old winning a putt‑putt golf game.
I give him a thumbs‑up and mocking smile. “Good work, champ!”
“Thanks, babe.” He kisses me on the cheek. “I’ll pick you up at eight forty‑five.”
“Alright, cool.” I quash the urge to tell him that it takes far longer than fifteen minutes to reach the restaurant from my place. “See you then.”
As soon as he leaves, I head for the shower. I need to wash the stench of him away.

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
Millie
I stand outside Maris’s ensuite, hearing the torrent of water beating down on the floor. Her bathroom has more amenities than mine, including far better shower pressure. I wait for her, as instructed, but my body is trembling. I don’t know what she has planned for me. Whenever she calls for me, I feel a pit of despair in my gut. I shouldn’t be afraid of her; she’s my twin sister. She’s the only one I have on my side, but the sound of her voice terrifies me. I love my sister very much. It’s not her fault that I do things wrong sometimes. She’s only helping me. She wants the best for me, and it’s only fair that I help her when she needs me. Any good sister would, right?
I wait dutifully for her, holding a heated towel. She reaches her hand out and snatches it from me. She opens the door once she’s wrapped the towel around herself. She’s standing on the bathmat as a bead of water trickles down her leg. She’s very big on etiquette. Mom always told us to never let a drop of water hit the floor after a bath or shower, and Maris stringently abides by that rule.
“Did you borrow my Valentino skirt?” she asks. She’s looking at the mirror, combing her hair.
“No, I haven’t borrowed anything.”
She turns to me. “Don’t fucking lie to me, Millie. I know you have.”
223
“Honestly, I haven’t.” I feel myself shake when she takes a step toward me.
She starts laughing. “I’m kidding, sooky sook. Relax.” She gives me a Chanel bodywash‑infused hug. She’s radiant, even without makeup. It’s what she uses to get her work done. Her turquoise doe eyes can enchant when she needs them to. If that doesn’t get them, her smile and slender, hourglass figure will. Only a few see the lack of life, the cold gaze, and affect when the show’s over. No one knows her better than me.
“You said you needed help. What do you want me to do?”
“Jeez, Millie, simmer down. You look like you’re about to have a goddamn coronary. I need you to drop a few things off at Hunter’s house for me.”
I exhale a breath I didn’t think I was holding. “I have plans with Susannah…I’m meant to meet her in half an hour.”
“Well, are you planning to spend the night with her or something? I wanted you to go around seven or eight, not right now.”
“Why, where are you going?”
“I’m meeting a friend.” She crosses her arms over her chest. “Is that alright, Mother?”
“Charles?” I know I’m pushing my luck. Maris isn’t fond of questions unless she’s the one firing them.
“If you absolutely must know, yes.” Her voice is cold and harsh. “I’m seeing Charles.”
I know she’s lying. Charles is back in Ellensburg with his grieving mother and sister. He called earlier, and I answered the phone—he thought he was speaking to her. I don’t blame him, even our parents can’t distinguish between us on the telephone. They can barely tell us apart in person.
“Alright. What do you want me to drop off?”
“Well, when I say ‘drop off,’ I mean I want you to go inside his room, hang out for a little while, real casual and all, and then put a couple of the items in his bedside cupboard and in his bookshelf when he undoubtedly takes his bathroom break. That
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
224
boy has the bladder of a ninety‑year‑old woman. Make sure he doesn’t see you.”
“Maris, seriously? I can’t do that. I’ve helped you enough, even when I’ve been sick or tired. Why can’t you go?”
“I just told you I have plans. Just fucking do it.” She drops her towel on the floor of her walk‑in wardrobe and puts on a red three‑piece lingerie set. Over it, she pulls on a white minidress with a sweetheart neckline. I think it’s my dress, but I don’t say anything.
“Fine, I’ll do it. You owe me for this. I was going to the movies.”
“The stuff’s on the bed,” she says. She pulls out a small bag of coke and does half a line. “Make sure you follow all my instructions, alright?”
“Are you ever sober anymore?”
She looks like she’s been slapped. “Listen, Millie, you should be happy I’m even talking to you after the stunt you pulled. Quit whining and do as you’re told.” She gets closer to me, her index finger two inches from my face. “Don’t you dare talk to Mother.” She stares at me through the mirror, eventually breaking out into a derisive grin. “Millie, it’s not brain surgery. You can leave now.”
“Yeah, of course.” I fight back tears, swallowing hard to keep my voice even.
I walk out of her room, but I don’t return to mine. Moving two doors down, I slip into the library, nestling myself into a chesterfield by the immaculately preserved first edition classic novels. There’s only so much Maris can get away with. I’m not far off my mother in my hearing ability, and I keep myself still and quiet to ensure I can hear everything from Maris’s room. I wait for her light footsteps on the carpet and then follow moments after, exclusively holding my weight in my toes—the one decent thing I learned from ten years of forced ballet training—making sure I can’t be heard. She’s always been a little paranoid, so I expect it when her gaze darts across the room as she slips her hand into the key bowl for her car keys. I hold my breath and duck behind the credenza. Once satisfied that she’s alone, she steps outside and climbs into her car. I wait again, less patiently this time. I want
H o ne y traT R A p
225
to know what she’s up to. Something has been very off about her lately, more so than usual. Not only evasive, she’s been blatantly lying to me, something that she never did before. To Mom and Dad, sure but never to me. I tail her in Mom’s old Aston Martin, the one she dented and then relegated to the back of the garage. I doubt Maris has seen it in years. I keep myself two cars behind her, but she’s speeding maniacally, slipping through red lights, and swerving in front of oncoming traffic. I lose her for a few moments, but I left a paint drip in her trunk. She wouldn’t notice it, but I see the sickly orange paint cementing the roads. She veers into the parking lot for a trashy Italian diner, Mama Barone’s, and I almost rear‑end the car in front of me.
Maris is very picky with what she eats, and she despises Italian food. She either eats fast food or fine French food with very little in between. I park on the street leading into the restaurant and watch her fiddle with her hair and retouch her lip gloss in the car while she waits. Another vehicle enters the parking lot, a beat‑up ’60s Volkswagen beetle. It’s shabby and gross, so I’m a little surprised when its owner hops out with perfectly coiffed hair and glossy patent leather shoes. He walks to my sister, opens her door for her, and offers his arm for support, which she takes. He looks familiar, but I can’t place him. I’m only good with my ears, Maris has the eyes. I sink down into my seat, hoping she doesn’t glance back. She doesn’t. She’s fixated on him and it’s mutual.
He leads her inside, and they’re seated in a booth by the window. I take the risk, driving into the lot and parking for a better view. Usually guys slobber over her (and me), taking every opportunity to touch her or get closer to her, but this dude is keeping his distance, despite the staring. He sits stiffly on his side of the table, perusing the menu. He rebuffs her advances when she tries to make contact. Panic races through me when I think she sees me, but I know she can’t in the dim light.
I look down at the trail of bruises from the last time I had a confrontation with her. I miss my sister. I want her back. She’s never been like this to me. She’s had her temper tantrums and
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
226
lashed out, but she’s not this cruel. I don’t know what’s happened to her. She doesn’t tell me anything anymore, she just yells and hits me. It honestly frightens me to see how similar she’s becoming to Dad. He’s a sadistic bastard. The brutality he inflicts on Mom is inhumane. Maris is the only one who can sway him. She’s managed to wrap him around her little finger. Even then, a self‑centered jerk isn’t easy to deal with. He’s never hurt her—not that I’m aware of, anyway, but Mom and I haven’t been lucky enough to elude his abuse. I watch this guy. He’s self‑conscious. I see him pat down his hair four times. They seem to be in deep discussion, which is quite odd because she never engages males in conversations beyond surface level. She guzzles down her drink but his remains untouched. I feel like one of those Peeping Toms who sits around watching women in stages of undress. This time, I don’t look away. I wish I had a listening device or could at least do a vague lip‑read. I stare at the man’s face, scrutinizing what little I can see. I know it from somewhere, it’s ringing a bell, but my mind is foggy. I don’t know for sure from this distance, but he doesn’t seem to be blinking very often. It’s kind of creepy. I’m restless in my car—I glance down at my Piaget every few minutes. The lot is getting busier, working-class families piling in for their weekly fancy meal.
They finally finish. The dude pays the bill, almost pushing Maris’s hand away when she offers her (or probably Dad’s) Amex. He leads her out, and they both smoke a cigarette in front of his car. I finally get a better look at his face. It’s very angular with sharp cheekbones and a fine, pointed nose. It hits me like a ton of bricks. It was a little while ago, July 7 after I’d gotten my nails done. I get my nails done on the seventh and the twenty‑first of every month, like clockwork. It was an extremely hot day, and I hadn’t had any real plans, so I drove out to Lake Sam for a dip. Unlike Maris, I prefer oceans and rivers to our utilitarian 200-foot lap pool. I had on this cute red bikini and a white miniskirt coverup. I’d staked out a little area for myself and put down a picnic blanket, a copy of Breakfast at Tiffany’s, and my bottle of suntan lotion. He’d sat down next to me, and he was attractive,
H o ne y traT R A p
227
so I wasn’t too bothered. He didn’t seem creepy or anything. I felt him staring at me, but every time I turned and tried to catch him, he looked away. He was pretending to read Gatsby. I was going to speak, but he beat me to it.
“I, uh, I read that a while ago. I really liked it,” he said, gesturing towards my paperback.
“Yeah, I love Truman Capote. I was studying his work in my literature class.” I smiled at him. “F. Scott Fitzgerald is great too.”
“Oh, uh, right. Yeah, I like Capote’s work.” He was nervous when he talked, and he mispronounced Capote. He was smartly dressed, very dapper, but also incredibly awkward. He had a slight stutter and an accent, maybe Canadian. “Do you live around here?”
“I live in Bellevue. I’m not too far from here.”
We made small talk, discussing topics he feigned to understand. He cut to the point within about five minutes.
“Look, uh, I, uh, don’t normally do this, but you’re absolutely beautiful. Would you like to, uh, get a drink with me tonight?”
I could see sweat trickling down the side of his forehead—probably only partially from the heat. “Listen, I’d love to, but I have a boyfriend. I am very flattered,” I told him. He was too shifty, too self‑conscious. My non‑existent boyfriend deserved more attention than he did. He didn’t take it too badly, and I didn’t think twice about it, leaving my spot to go for a quick swim to cool off. When I got back, he was gone. I stayed for a couple of hours, reading, and then I drove home. I’m not trying to act like I’m a wonderfully good‑looking person but, more often than not, I get guys hitting on me and trying to take me out. He wasn’t especially memorable. Yes, he was nice‑looking and had decent facial features, but so do a lot of boys. I didn’t talk to him again.
I went home, where Charles was. This boy is by far the most attractive person I’ve ever seen. I’m entirely confident about that. The day Maris brought him to the house, I struggled to keep my composure, feeling like I was going to have a stroke. I’m not a sicko, I don’t want to share a boy with my sister, but I knew I was going to struggle to avoid him. I’d never felt like that about
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
228
anyone. I could see Mom fawning over him, Dad becoming livid to see the effect he had on women. Charles has these blue eyes and dimples that make me buckle at the knees, as cheesy and gross as that sounds. Maris had her claws in very deep. I didn’t know where she found him, but he was just another plaything for her. She’s not capable of any true emotion, so it’s unfair of her to hoard him when she can easily draw someone else in. If I’d mentioned it to her, she wouldn’t have been cruel about it, despite her general sadism, she would’ve played nice and backed off slightly, gifting him to me as it were. But she would’ve lorded it over my head for the rest of my fucking life. So, I didn’t tell her. I went into Charles’s room, and he knew I wasn’t Maris, that was only a mistake he could make over the phone, not in person. I was sitting there on the bed with him, my voice raspy and my head spinning, absolutely overwhelmed. I wasn’t taking in a word he said. I wasn’t taking in anything other than his beautiful face. He made Robert Redford look passe. I was wearing some lovely lingerie underneath my gown. He enjoyed it. I felt guilty about it, even more so when Maris eventually came in, drunk and wired. I pretended it didn’t happen. He did, too, which hurt me more than it should’ve. I get attached. Not often, but when I do, it hits hard. Seeing him crawl back to Maris was brutal.
I watch Maris follow the well‑dressed man’s car in her Porsche, ten over the speed limit. I wait a couple of minutes before tailing her. She used to be fastidious, but now she’s getting sloppy with her work, especially when she’s intoxicated. The paint dripping from her car would’ve caught her eagle eye immediately a year ago. There have been so many “incidents”—as she calls them—in recent times that she’s become disordered, leaving behind evidence, and missing obvious details. She always justifies the acts to me, and they make sense. I’ve never questioned or pushed against it because men do hurt women. Men hurt women all the time, without remorse, without guilt, without empathy, so why should we feel anything for them? I’ve watched my father abuse my mother all my life. I know what they’re capable of. And there is no world in which I’d sell my sister down the river for hurting a man.
H o ne y traT R A p
229
I’m trying my best to be inconspicuous, but it’s difficult once I see Maris driving down toward a secluded spot in Issaquah, a trail leading to Tiger Mountain. I stop the car well before I enter. I recognize her playground—it’s only accessible by foot. My heart is racing. He’s not a victim. Maybe she is. I don’t know what to do. I keep myself hidden behind the interlacing, leafy trees, praying that the sound of the leaves crunching beneath my feet can’t be heard by Maris or the man. There’s the familiar smell of decay and the evening chill is kicking in, sending through me a violent shiver.
I see her. Nude and decomposing. A blonde with a striking resemblance to Carol.
They’re standing a couple of feet away from her, chatting casually. Maris takes a cigarette out of her purse and lights it, taking several long drags. Spirals of smoke stream behind. I don’t realize I’m sobbing until tears trickle down my chin, falling onto my chest. I’m overcome with the memories and feelings I’ve been unable to face. This girl reminds me that my sweet friend has been ravaged and ripped apart. She would lend me books and cheer me up every time Maris would make me cry when we were at school together. She made my life bearable when Dad would put out a cigarette on my skin or shatter a bone. She would come into the hospital with cards and violets, my favorite flower, and tell me about what stupid things Hunter did in class, to cheer me up. I adored her. I feel bile rising, and I fight it as hard as I can. Maris puts her foot on the girl’s decapitated head, digging it deeper into the ground with her heel. When I look past her, I see a male corpse, not yet in the same stage of putrefaction. Blonde hair and green eyes. I can’t hear what they’re saying, but Maris collapses into a fit of giggles. I want to strangle her. She said violence against women was foul, something she’d never do, and I believed her. I can’t handle anymore, but I can’t risk them hearing me running.
I muffle my sobs with the back of my hand. I wish I’d done what she told me to. Hunter is comforting and kind, and she’s wicked and callous. My legs feel as if they’re about to give way,
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
230
my head isn’t far behind, and I feel dizzy and detached from my body. I have to believe I’m dreaming or imagining; this can’t be my reality. I cry quietly, the way I learned to when Maris would injure me and then threaten to do worse if I ratted to Mom, wanting to throw up what I’ve eaten today—half a hamburger from McDonald’s.
Minutes drag on like days, and I shake from the cold night air. My strength wanes, but I hold on until Maris finally turns to leave, laughing as she gives the head one last sickening kick. The man follows, hands stuffed into his pockets, and climbs into his car. Maris takes the lead, and the man’s car trails her.
I let myself collapse onto the wet dirt and my vomiting follows. I need ample time for them to leave and make sure they don’t come back and see me. I can’t stop the tears, and my hands feel grubby when I try to wipe my face. When I can finally get myself together, I head back to my car—the walk feels like a marathon. I know the muck will follow me in, staining the seats. I’ll need another carwash. I can’t go home, not like this. I find myself driving instinctively to Hunter’s house but not with the items Maris wanted me to take. It’s late but he’ll be awake. He doesn’t go to bed until at least 3 AM. I hope Maris isn’t there. She isn’t someone I can face right now. I wish I could go to Charles, but he wouldn’t have me instead of Maris.
“Hey, Millie, I didn’t know you were coming over,” he greets me, shirtless at the door. Normally, it’d be one of the maids answering this late at night. I’m grateful he recognizes that it’s me. He’s quite often mistaken me for Maris. She’s trained me to speak like her, dress like her and, most importantly, flirt like her. He’s a lot less observant than Charles.
“I know, I didn’t plan to, but here I am.” I stand in the doorway. “Well, can I come in?”
“Of course, you can. What happened to you?” He gestures at the dirt on my clothing.
“I’m a little bit drunk, and I had a tumble. I didn’t want to go home like this. You know how my parents can be.” I laugh.
H o ne y traT R A p
231
“Quinn would be so stunned, I’m sure. Come on in, and I’ll see if I can find any of Maris’s clothes in my room. I’m bound to have something. That girl sheds clothes like a snake sheds skin.”
I roll my eyes and laugh, genuinely laugh, for the first time all day. He steers me up the stairs, to his floor. One of the benefits of being an only child, I suppose. His room is spotless, as always, methodically designed and maintained. He rifles through his wardrobe until he gets to a myriad of dresses, Halston, Chanel, and Valentino. I never cared very much about designer clothes, but Mom wouldn’t have one of her daughters turning up to an event (or even lounging around the house) in a Sears outfit, and Maris wouldn’t let me hear the end of it. I pick the least fancy, a sparkly lame gold minidress. “A little bit much, but it’ll do, I suppose,” I say, taking it off the rack. He looks away as I get changed and then asks me to toss over my dirty clothes.
“I’ll get Larissa to wash them, and I’m sure Maris can bring them back to you.”
“Thanks, you’ve always got my back.”
“Of course. What happened, anyway? You’d have to be out drinking in the woods. Is there something you’re hiding from us, Mill? You’re not an alcoholic, are you?” He laughs.
“No, that’s your girlfriend. I’m kidding, of course. Maris is a good girl. She wouldn’t be a drunkard.”
“Oh, come on, Millie, Maris is anything but good. I love her but, Jesus Christ, that girl is fucking crazy. That’s usually the case with the really sexy ones. Not much up top.” He taps his temple with his index finger. There’s a little voice inside me that is pushing me to remind him that she’s in med school, and he failed very basic arts units, and it takes a lot of effort to quash it. It’s been programmed into me since I was tiny. Maris can’t be insulted. I must react. A good sister always defends, explains away, deflects.
“You, of all people, would know she’s brainy. You deal with her the most.”
“Well, not lately. I never get to see her anymore, she’s always too busy. Tell me something, Millie. Is there something going
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
232
on with her and that weird guy that’s living in your house?” He pauses. “And why exactly is that guy living with you guys?”
“Hunter, I could really use a drink right now.”
“Of course. I’m sorry for being rude. What would you like?”
“A martini. Or a gin and tonic. Actually, anything with gin.”
He stares at me and laughs again. “You’re not doing a good job of convincing me you’re not an alcoholic. I’ve got you, though, don’t worry.” He reaches for the telephone on his bedside table and asks one of the kitchen staff for a martini and a Diet Coke. “You have to level with me. You can’t need alcohol unless it’s something bad. Just tell me. Is Maris cheating on me?”
The names threaten to tumble out, all at once. Charles. Christopher. Jack. Stephen. Lilith. Heather. All the nameless boys too. I sit still and force myself to focus.
“You’re my only close friend right now. Jack’s gone AWOL after Carol. He is always crying. He feels so guilty about it. And Stephen’s always busy.”
Hunter doesn’t realize why Jack feels guilty. It’s not about Carol’s disappearance, it’s about the fact that he was about to leave her for Maris only days before the worst happened. He’d been sneaking around with her, thinking she’d dump Hunter for him too. He was misinformed. There was no chance of that happening. The merger of Hunter’s family and ours is inevitable and the most profitable for her. Her side pieces would always remain that way, despite the glimmers of hope she gave them. Maris has been cheating on Hunter for about as long as they’ve been dating. I’ve never divulged that information to anyone. I’ve been sworn to secrecy. I don’t want to end up bruised and bloodied. There’s a knock on the door, and thankfully alcohol comes with it. I sip my martini, enjoying the little lemon twist Larissa added. “She’s not cheating on you.” I avoid his gaze.
“You’re not a good liar.”
He’s wrong. I’m one of the best. I’m crafty. I’ve lied directly to him more times than I can count. It’s just that I don’t want to lie anymore. I don’t want to protect someone this vile. Someone who could do this to someone she claimed to love. The image of
H o ne y traT R A p
233
her foot on the decapitated head makes me want to hurl. It keeps flashing in my mind. Maris laughing, Carol decaying.
“What do you want me to say?”
“I need the truth. Please. No one’s talking to me right now.” He sits down on his obsessive‑compulsively made bed and pulls on a white polo shirt. I feel sorry for him, for the way he’s been treated. His best friend, his girlfriend. The two people he should be able to trust the most. Maris enjoys putting him through the wringer. She knows he’ll stay. She loves the slow torture, the mind control, keeping him on the hook. That’s the way she is with men. She’s on the mark with Hunter. She’s always said he’s slow, and he must be to not know how often she cheats on him. I mean, he’d have to be an imbecile. A complete imbecile. She does it so brazenly. She rubs his face in it. I think that’s the only reason why she’s keeping Charles at our house. He’s her temporary plaything, but she knows how much it’s bothering Hunter, so he’s becoming more of a permanent fixture.
“I don’t think it’s Maris you need to talk to. I think you need a conversation with Jack.”
“Jack’s been avoiding me.” He looks like he’s about to cry. I feel horrible. I don’t understand Maris’s motivation. I don’t understand how things like this make her feel good. I give him a hug, and he rests his head against me. “Mill, you’re truly the only person I can talk to. You’ve got to know something.”
I wish I could tell him what was actually devastating. Cheating is one thing, but it doesn’t compare to the heinous activity she’s been involved in. Carol was her best friend, and she would’ve met the same fate as the blonde at Tiger Mountain. To degrade and humiliate her corpse, one would have to be dead inside or blackmailed for something worse. I can’t give her up if she’s doing it to hide her own murders, no matter how sick it makes me feel. I can, however, relieve my burden slightly by outing her infidelity.
“She and Jack were sleeping together before Carol went missing,” I blurt out.

Color drains from his face. He really didn’t know. He goes limp in my arms, so I pull away and sit beside him. I gulp down the remains of the martini and feel it churn in my stomach.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. She would kill me. I’ve felt so guilty about it.”
I see a tear trickle down his cheek, but he quickly wipes it away, concentrating his stare on the carpet and sitting very still. It takes him a while to speak. “How long has it been going on?”
“A while. Six months, maybe. He was going to dump Carol. He thought Maris would dump you, but she never would.”
“Does she still love me?”
I don’t think Maris is capable of loving anyone other than herself and me. I still answer. “Yes.”
“Well, everyone slips up sometime, don’t they?” he rationalizes. A forlorn little boy.
“Yes, of course. I shouldn’t have said anything. Maris will kill me. Jack will kill me.”
“Did Jack talk to you about this?”
“No, he kept sneaking out. Maybe he forgets that my bedroom is right under Maris’s and the staircase goes right past me. He hasn’t come over in a week now.” My throat is burning, and my mind is flooded with images of the blonde girl’s severed head. I don’t know how many drinks I’ll need to make it all go away. One is not enough. I want to lie down on the floor and sleep, but I’m scared to close my eyes. I have night terrors already.
“I just…I don’t know. I don’t understand. I thought she was mad at me.”
“Why would she be mad at you?” She treats him like an indentured servant. She’s explained it to me, he hurt her when she was younger, so she has the right to hurt him now, for as long as she wishes to. She always makes him feel like he’s done something wrong.
“I didn’t take her to Swan Lake. She really wanted to go. I was sick.”
H o ne y traT R A p

“Look, I doubt she’s upset that you missed the Seattle Opera once. It’s not like she hasn’t seen Swan Lake before a gazillion times.”
“She blew me off right after that too. Told me she was sick that time. I know Maris. That’s exactly the type of thing she would do to get back at me. And then within about ten minutes, she and this Charles weirdo are glued at the hip. I’d made a reservation at her favorite place. The guy threw a snit about it being so last minute too.”
“I don’t know what to tell you, Hunter. Your girlfriend is a problem. None of us understand her.” I don’t want to either. I don’t want to get inside that mind. Maris has many filters, so I can only imagine how dark it’d be in there without them. I wonder how her psychiatrist sleeps.
“I don’t think she’d cheat on me, honestly. She can be a bit shifty, but she’s not a liar or a cheat,” he says with false resolve.
Carol’s face flashes again. “Hunter, I think I’m going to be sick.” I run to the bathroom and keel over the sink. He follows, handing me a Kleenex box. He holds my hair as I heave. “I’m sorry,” I say. “I’m really sorry.”
“Relax, Millie. It’s alright. Nothing I haven’t seen before.” He strokes the top of my head.
“Larissa will clean it up.”
“You’re so sweet, Hunter.” I wipe my mouth with the Kleenex. I feel grateful for his company. While a bit ditzy, he’s truly sweet, kinder than Maris deserves. He gives me a hug, the awkward kind that platonic males and females give to one another. He doesn’t realize that we’ve been a lot more intimate than this, and for that I’m glad. Maris wanted to keep it under wraps. It was a ploy.
“I think you need to lay off the drink for tonight.”
“I think so too. I want another martini, but I don’t want to mess up your floor.” My hands are too clammy to handle glass. I turn on the tap and tilt my head under it, rinsing out my mouth before gargling a shot of his Listerine. I wash my face and wipe it off with a hand towel. I’m unsteady as I walk back to my seat.

“Can I get you some water? You’re a bit pale. I’m glad you care. At least one of the Caldwell girls does.”
Does he think I’m this upset about Maris cheating on him? It’s fine if he does. I wouldn’t be able to explain the real reason anyway, not without Maris being arrested. I can’t do that to her. Not even if my stomach twists in agony, and I must spend days hunched over a toilet bowl. At least I’ll never have to diet. “No, I’m okay, thank you, though.”
“Come on, sit down. Don’t go falling over again.” He guides me back to my seat.
“I thought you’d be angrier,” I tell him. “You don’t deserve to be treated like that.”
“Well, there’s no point being angry at you. You didn’t do anything. I mean, you could’ve told me earlier, and I thought you would, but at least I know now.”
“He’s not the only one, Hunter,” I say quietly. My will buckles. I hadn’t planned to tell him any of this.
“What do you mean?”
“You can never tell her that I told you.”
“Millie, we’re beyond that.” He steels himself.
It’s the one that’ll hurt him the most. “Stephen.”
He laughs for what seems like a minute straight. “Now I know you’re fucking with me. Not Stephen, she wouldn’t.”
“I guess Stephen was studying physiology with Maris in her room, must be why his clothes were in our hamper. Isn’t he majoring in engineering, though?”
I want him to feel the same rage I do. I want him to hate her as much as I do. I want her to face consequences for what she’s done. This is the only way I can do it. I’m in agony. Carol deserved better. They all did. I did.
I startle when he smashes his nightstand lamp against the wall.
“Jesus, what the fuck, Hunter? You’re going to wake everyone up.”
“No, my room’s soundproof. You know that.” He looks down at a shard of glass in his palm. It’s pierced through his skin, forming an unsightly tear.

“I shouldn’t have said anything.”
“No, you should have. You should’ve done it a hell of a lot sooner. I can’t believe you would hide this from me.” He shakes his head. “No, I’m sorry. I know Maris, she’d murder you.”
I feel sick again when I hear the word. I wish I were him. I wish I could be ignorant, raging about my wholesome little girlfriend cheating on me, not being aware of things that matter. He’s thinking about her perfect body and her glorious, innocent‑devil face, wondering why it doesn’t belong to him alone. I’m thinking of my best friend being decapitated. Tears start flowing again, but he of course thinks it’s about him and his relationship.
“It’s okay, Millie. I’m sorry for snapping at you. It’s not your fault,” he reassures me.
I want to run away, go back to our villa in Barcelona and lie on the daybed in the sun, weeping in the fetal position, as far as I can be from Maris geographically. I can’t face Carol’s mother. Mrs. Greene’s agony has been unmissable, and I’d had no idea what was going on—it was bad enough then. Now that I do know, I won’t be able to be in the same room with her without cracking, which will make Maris crack my skull open. I seek refuge in Hunter’s arms, in his fastidiously tidy room, in his oblivious friendship.
“I’m sorry, Hunter. I really am. I wish I could tell you everything.”
“Is there more?” He pales.
I stare down at the floor. I can’t talk anymore without dissolving into absolute hysteria. I could write him a list on his monogrammed stationery, but even I know it wouldn’t be comprehensive. Maris claims to show me one hundred percent of her life, but I find it impossible to believe. She would hide plenty from me too. The notches in her bedpost are more plentiful in her knowledge than mine. She’d hide them like she hides her (infrequent but very real) D grades. She can’t ruin her chaste, straight‑A image. She can’t be a known bisexual. She only studies, exercises and has sex within her monogamous ten‑year relationship. Nobody would even believe me if I told them the
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
238
truth. She is much better with her words than I am. She can enchant, her compliments spiraling through people until they radiate sunshine, until they feel infallible. I don’t have that kind of charm on my side. I’m blunt. I strive to be honest in all situations that don’t involve her. I don’t flatter people for favors, I physically cannot. My brain freezes, my mouth jams. Unless she’s with me, prodding me, or has sent me on a job, I stay silent and observant. I’m either with her or I’m thinking about her. I could confidently say that about everyone that is in her orbit, but it’s not all adulation like she believes.
Hunter wipes the gash on his hand, using a tissue in the place of a Band‑Aid.
“Oh, Hunter, come here. You’re going to hurt yourself.” Maris is the doctor of the family, but I’m the one that took the MCAT for her, not that she’ll ever admit it. She begged me for days, then resorted to threats. I put pressure on the wound, which soon soaks through the tissue. “Jesus.”
“I’m fine,” he tells me, clearly choking back tears of pain. “It’s just a little cut.”
“Where’s the Dettol?”
“In the bathroom vanity. I don’t need it.”
“Yes, you do. Here, press on this while I get some.” I move his fingers to where mine had been. I force them down and slide open the vanity. I find a small bottle of antiseptic behind a stash of barbiturates and Motrin. My eyes catch a glimpse of gold. I dig a little deeper. I see Carol’s amethyst and white‑gold birthstone ring hiding in a little nook. I have no doubt Maris is the one that stripped it off her friend’s cold, dead finger to hide in her boyfriend’s bathroom. I don’t know why, though. I leave it untouched and return to Hunter.
His bleeding has subsided, but he winces when I dab some of the Dettol on the cut. “Fuck, Mill. I know it’s not your fault. I shouldn’t blow up at you.”
“It’s alright, don’t worry about it. I’d probably react the same way.”

“I know what’ll cheer us up. I recorded a couple of episodes of Mary. I know how much you love her.”
Maris and I always cuddle up on the sofa‑bed to watch Mary together. It’s the only thing that can calm me down when I’m panicking, and it soothes her too. That or The Brady Bunch. I love Marcia. It’s a sister thing, though. It’s something I only do with Maris, and we never let anyone invade our private hobby. I’m not about to start now. Besides, I hardly think a television show will help ease his mind: he knows his girlfriend is cheating on him with not one but several of his own friends.
“I’d love to watch a movie. Do you have Valley of the Dolls?” It’s the perfect movie to zone out to and worry about Sharon Tate’s woes rather than your own. Surely, nothing’s worse than getting your breasts cut off when they’re your only redeeming quality.
“Yes, I do. Maris loves it.” He opens the cupboard under the television and quickly scans the expansive list of titles. He pulls it out with precision. The other videos remain neat and stacked. He presses play and the VCR whirrs. “Come here, it’s a lot more comfortable,” he tells me when he climbs back on to his bed, patting the spot next to him.
Well, I have nothing to lose now. I sit beside him. Burrow into him. I can’t derive strength from him, but at least I can distract myself. Maybe that’s why Maris keeps him around. To bring her back in from the lip of the peril she enjoys so much. The opening scenes are warm and familiar. I know first‑hand how much Maris loves this movie.
“Why do you stay with her, Hunter?” It’s something I’ve always wanted to know but have never had the nerve to ask. He hardly has the motives of someone like Mom, who relies on Dad’s status, wealth, and the public image she must wear, all of which, to her, outweigh the bruises on her body and the decades of mental trauma.
He is silent for a while, the only voice in the room is Barbara Parkins’s. He turns to me. “She’s the only person who makes me truly happy.”

It’s not the answer I expected. The usual answer is how pretty she is, how fun she is. Her charm can only be spread so far, fleeting in nature, and when it wears off, brutality can result. Ten years would certainly do it.
“I mean, obviously she’s an absolute knockout. You’ve seen her. You’ve seen how guys act around her. But it’s more than that. I couldn’t live without her. She has so much more to her than just that face.” He breaks out into a goofy grin. “You’re a pal, Mill, and I know you’re identical, but there’s something special about her. That’s how I know it’s not about looks. There’s a connection I could never have with anyone else.”
I don’t know if I should feel insulted or yell at him—that’s how she makes everyone feel. He’s not special to her.
“That’s why I’m devastated. I can’t imagine her with someone else or anyone putting their hands on her. She’s the most valuable thing in my life. The happiest I’ll ever be is at our wedding.”
I’m tempted to buy a bottle of bleach and take away any resemblance I share. Maybe get a piercing on my tongue, tattoo my forehead, see a plastic surgeon like a D‑list celebrity. Instead, I move toward Hunter, place my hand on the back of his neck and kiss him. I wait for him to recoil, but he doesn’t. I want to mark Maris’s territory as my own, to defy her and hold it over her head for the rest of her life. Hunter’s arm twists around my waist, and he pulls me into him. I can feel his taut abdomen against mine and his lips are soft, probably due to the ChapStick he claims to not use. I’m crossing a boundary now. I feel wonderful, rebellious. It’s not quite the revenge Carol deserves, but it’s a minor victory. I can taste his minty toothpaste, smell the faint scent of his aftershave. His hair is freshly washed and almost glossier than mine. I let the lust and rage flood through me as I pull off his shirt.
“Millie, we probably shouldn’t do this,” he tells me, unzipping my—her—dress. He kisses my neck, along my collarbone and then down my chest. “You’re so beautiful, Maris.”
I pretend I don’t hear him calling my sister’s name. He is lying to himself, pretending he’s with her. I’m not selfish like Maris. I know that her sexual conquests are only of interest to her when
H o ne y traT R A p
241
she’s the one being pleasured. I’ve heard all the gory details; I’ve seen them. She’s proactive with her victims, not her lovers. This is where she and I differ, and I’m going to show Hunter that. I let him undress me and stare.
His fingers trace down the center of my body to my navel. It’s undiscovered and familiar terrain all at once for him. “Keep going,” I tell him as he slips my underwear off. “Please.” It’s not a word I often have to use in this context, but the desire pecks away at my will and pride, about to consume me whole. I want to feel him. I want him to drive the pain out. His mouth travels to my hips and between, and I wrap my legs around him. I hold him in close. I lose myself in the pleasure, grabbing the headboard to keep steady. I hear the moans, almost secondhand, as I drift from my body toward paradise. He doesn’t rush, and I climax sooner than I usually do (if I do at all). The tingles radiate down my legs continually afterwards. I’m soon breathless, and I can’t offer any more than a simple thanks. Instead, I stay quiet. It’s my turn to take care of him. To allow him to see what he deserves and what he’s been doing without. His body is wonderful: tanned, lean and just the right amount of muscular. My heart races, and I know my face is an embarrassing shade of red. I didn’t expect it to feel this way.
I don’t usually engage in casual sex. It’s never been right for me. I’ve always found the buildup more rewarding, memorizing someone’s reactions and cravings and letting them discover you. I need sex to be in the confines of a relationship, preferably monogamous, as lame as that sounds in the era of “free love” and second‑wave feminist promiscuity. I feel flustered but excited as this isn’t as transactional as I’d imagined. He props himself up on his forearms and fishes in the bedside drawer for a condom. The palatial door to his room opens, and I spring up, my heart racing. Mrs. Carlyle, or Camille as she insists on me calling her, walks in. Her strawberry‑blonde hair is coiffed into a painful‑looking French pleat, and she has on a full face of makeup but only a silk bathrobe instead of one of her traditional Chanel dresses.

“Oh dear, I’m so sorry,” she says with a visual flinch. “Hunter, I came in to let you know Maris is at the door.” Initially, she covers her eyes with the back of her hand, then she narrows in on me. The realization soon kicks in. “What on earth are you doing with Millicent?” It comes out as a shriek. “Your girlfriend is downstairs.”
“Mom, you should knock. I’d get smacked if I barged in on you and Dad,” he deflects.
“I can’t believe you would do this to your girlfriend.” She turns to look at me again. “Or your sister. Absolutely disgusting.”
I can’t seem to formulate a sentence, so I lay silently, wishing I could pull the covers over my face and disappear the way I used to believe possible at age four. I stare at the wall because I can’t meet her condemnatory glare.
“The sweet girl is in the foyer. What do you want me to do about this, Hunter?” She can demand an answer from him. He’s blood, I’m not. I’m nothing.
“Can you keep her busy for five minutes. Just let Millie get dressed.”
“Keep her busy? She’s not a child, Hunter. This is disgraceful. Put on some clothes and go downstairs to meet your girlfriend.” She gives me another mordacious look. “I suggest you get dressed in the meantime—I would say take the back exit, but I’m sure she’s seen the car. Lord, what would Quinn say?”
Maybe Mother would let her know what lovely Maris is like without an audience, but I don’t say it. “Yes, Mrs. Carlyle. Please don’t mention this to my mother. It was an accident.”
“I’d prefer it if you didn’t come back to our home for some time, I’m so disappointed in you. I’d always thought you were such a lovely girl.”
“I am, I haven’t changed, Mrs. Carlyle. I’m sorry.”
“It’s not me you need to apologize to.”
“Lay off her, Mom,” snaps Hunter. “Get out of my room.” He’s irritated but elated at the thought of Maris here. I can see he’s struggling to contain his happiness. My soul is being eviscerated. H o ne y traT R A p
243
Everything from tonight comes flooding back. I want to cry. I wish I hadn’t seen it. I wish I’d driven the car off the side of a cliff.
She’s calm but forceful, which propels Hunter to his feet. He awkwardly threads his arm through his t‑shirt. She leaves and closes the door behind her.
“Hunter, you can’t tell Maris,” I tell him, blinking back tears. “About any of it. I wasn’t here, we weren’t in bed, and you don’t know that she’s seen Jack or Stephen. Please, Hunter.”
“I won’t tell her, don’t worry. You know my mom. She’s probably had enough Percocet to forget this conversation tomorrow. Just get dressed.” He smooths down the bed. I put on the overly dramatic dress. I anticipate a barrage of questions about why I’m in possession of it. I shift to the wingback chair, not wanting to re‑rumple the sheets on the bed. Maris glides in on six‑inch platforms. The gauzy material of her skirt trails behind her.
“What are you doing here?” she asks, first curious, then suspicious. “In my dress.”
“Well, we didn’t want to spoil the surprise about planning a birthday getaway for you,” says Hunter. He manages to not fumble. I don’t think I could say the same about myself.
“In my dress?”
“That’s a long story.”
She smiles at me, the smile reserved for when she’s furious but is pretending not to be. She glances down at the white‑gold Piaget (identical to mine) on her delicate wrist. “You know what, darling? I’ve got time,” she tells me, plonking herself down onto the bed. My leg breaks into a nervous twitch. The hawk eyes zero in on it right away.
“Hunter and I got a little drunk at Dante’s, and I took a tumble and ruined my outfit. I didn’t want Mom to see, of course.”
She stares at me and then breaks. “It’s not a shock, Millie, you’ve always been a bit of a klutz. Remember when you had that obsession with roller skating and fell into a trashcan in Central Park? That was a hoot!”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
244
It’s not the best of memories, so I don’t try to recall it often, but I laugh with her. “I had those hotpants Mom said belonged on a streetwalker on the Lower East Side.”
“Daddy still has them in his home office. On the bottom shelf next to his little booze stash.”
“My hotpants?”
“No, you ninny, those roller skates. What kind of a person would keep their teenage daughter’s fashion crimes on hand?”
“Of course. Anyway, I should get going. If Mom asks, I’ve been at a party.”
“Wait, I’ll come with you. I only came by to say hello to my boyfriend since he thinks I’m avoiding him,” she says pointedly, glaring at him. Under recent circumstances, I can see why he flinches.
“Can’t you stay the night?” He sounds like he’s about to start bawling.
“No, you know I can’t get a good night’s sleep with someone else in my bed. We can get breakfast in the morning.”
Hunter snorts. The likelihood of catching Maris awake before eleven is incredibly low, even for people she lives with. An outsider has no chance. “Just call me when you get up, and I’ll pick you up for waffles.”

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
Millie
I reach the house about ten minutes after Maris, despite leaving at approximately the same time. I didn’t have the energy to continue driving like a lunatic to keep up with her. Besides, I feel like I’d be dead by now if I started taking the reckless turns she does. She’s waiting for me in the foyer, dangling her bare feet off the edge of the three-person stool.
“Is there something you want to tell me, Millie?” She reaches her hand out to steady me as I try to slip off my shoes. “Is it normal to find your sister at your boyfriend’s place this late at night?”
“It’s been alright every time it’s been your idea. Suddenly, it’s not when it’s mine.”
Her laugh is ominous. “You clearly have something to say. Let’s talk in my room.” She looks around expectantly as if Mom will pop out of the shadows. She drops her purse on the floor and takes the stairs two at a time. I find myself following unconsciously.
I vow to stay silent, to not mention a thing. I’ll keep it a secret, pretend I didn’t see anything. Fight the nausea, fight the voice in my head. It’s not worth the consequences. I steel myself as she sits down on her little Chesterfield loveseat and pulls me into her lap. She plays with my hair and kisses my cheek. “What’s going
246
on with you?” Her voice is gentle, sweet. My skin crawls, and my resolve lasts for all of three point four seconds.
“I saw you.”
She stares at me. “You saw me what?”
I pull away from her and choose to sit on the end of the bed. I don’t want her touching me. It’s not even fear anymore; it’s genuine revulsion. “I fucking saw you, Maris. Tonight.”
“You’re going to have to elaborate,” she tells me calmly.
“With Carol.”
“Carol’s dead, Millie. What are you talking about?”
I feel the tears gushing down my face. “You killed her. You killed your own best friend.”
“Millie, are you huffing glue? I’m asking in all seriousness. You must be on something.”
“I saw you with her and that guy at Tiger Mountain. I saw the decapitated head.”
She flounders to maintain her composure. Her skin pales. “I knew someone was tailing me. I’m such a moron.”
“Why did you do it?”
“Oh, get a grip, for fuck’s sake. I didn’t kill little Carol. I don’t much care for hurting women.”
“I’m going to see that girl’s beheaded body for the rest of my life. Carol must’ve looked exactly the same. She wouldn’t have been spared. You can do a little better than swearing and deflecting,” I shout.
“Millicent, be quiet. You’re going to wake the bitch,” she hisses at me. “I didn’t kill Carol. Ted did.”
“Bullshit he did. You’re a liar. You’re pathetic. I don’t know how you can live with yourself. You can’t keep your lies straight or your legs closed.”
“Says the girl trying to fuck my boyfriend. Honestly, if that boring dud makes you happy, you can go for it. I have a new toy three bedrooms down.”
“You killed your best friend. You are scum.”
“How many times do you want me to repeat myself? I didn’t kill her.”
H o ne y traT R A p
247
“Did she rape and amputate herself?”
“Women can’t rape. That was a male designed crime. I don’t have the necessary appendage for that, you know? Kind of hard to grow a penis and produce semen overnight. Stop shooting yourself in the foot. Rub those two brain cells together and think about it for a second.”
“So, you didn’t rape her. That doesn’t mean you didn’t kill her or at least help the man who did.”
“Why would I do that?” Her expression is devoid of emotion. It makes me want to rip her throat out.
“Oh, I don’t know, Maris, all you do is cause misery. You should be dead. Not Carol.”
“Boy, that was a logically sound, utterly compelling theory, how on earth will I defend myself against that one, Sherlock?” She yawns for effect. “Are you done yet? I need some sleep.”
I reach under her bed for her penknife before I can stop myself. I look directly at Maris, pin her down and hold it against her neck. She doesn’t even flinch. She pauses for a second and then grins. She grabs my wrist and twists it sharply until I hear a crack and feel searing pain down my arm. Maris may not let me live through the night.
“If I can take down men who are double my weight, do you think you’d be a challenge?” Her voice drifts down from above me. I can’t move my hand.
“You always need my help,” I tell her through clenched teeth, tears streaming down my face. “Every male.” I’ve endured her abuse for years. I’ve developed a tolerance for pain, but this is a particularly bad injury. She’s broken my wrist. I try to pull away from her, but she grabs the Bible she keeps on her nightstand and slams it down on my hand. I let out a scream and double over. She kicks me in the gut and then steps on my face with considerable force.
“Don’t you dare try to claim victory for any of my achievements.”
I lay on the floor crying and shaking. She watches me, evidently disgusted.

“Boy, you’re pathetic, you really are,” she says. “I can’t believe I’m related to you.”
“Maris, you broke my wrist. I need to go to the hospital. Please.” I know I should bolt, but my entire body feels numb, heavy.
“I’m going to watch Mary first. You’ll survive.” She settles into her bed, reaches over for the television remote and turns the volume of the set up to drown out my whimpers. “Jesus, Millie, it’s a wrist. Dial it down a notch.”
Mary’s voice is normally a solace, comforting and sweet, but I can’t focus on it through the pain. I stay on the floor and try to quieten down. If I anger Maris, this could get brutal. I don’t know what else she could do to me today. Better a broken wrist than a broken hyoid bone. Mary is talking to the annoying new character Sue Ann Nevins, and Maris laughs when she hears that Sue Ann would rather flush her veal down the toilet than serve it reheated. Tears are still pricking at my eyes. I struggle in pain. If I try to get to Mom for help…I always had faith in Maris to not hurt me, but if she could violate Carol that way, I’d end up similarly. Normally, Maris would not strike my face—that would leave bruises. I try not to speculate how Carol had been murdered, what she would’ve endured, how she was callously desecrated. She was such a gentle, sweet girl. I’m not going to let her die in vain. I need to survive and not set Maris off. I can’t be of much use from a grave. I’m patient. I wait for the twenty‑two minutes of the show and eight minutes of commercials to pass. I ask her again, softer. “Maris, can you please take me to the hospital?”
She sighs, terribly inconvenienced. “Yes, alright, Millie. I’m not sticking around, though. I need to get some sleep. I’m very tired.”
“You can just drop me off,” I agree weakly. I’m bleeding from my cheek. “Outside, even, if you want.”
She rolls her eyes at me. “Oh, thank you, your grace. How kind.” She grabs a light coat from her wardrobe and pulls it on. She helps lift me, propping me up against her side. I lean on her for support when walking down the staircase. She’s gentle as

she tucks me into the passenger seat of her car and straps on my seatbelt. “I’m sorry,” she tells me quietly before climbing into her seat. “I snapped. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I couldn’t believe you’d claim I’d do those things to Carol, of all people, and then you pulled a knife on me. I don’t know how you think I could hurt her. I had nothing to do with it.”
I’m timid but I try. “Why were you there?”
“Look, Ted knows some things that I can’t afford for him to know. I have to play along so that I don’t get caught out. I would think you’d understand that.”
“How long have you known about Carol?” I wince as the pain flares up. I’m desperate for an opiate hit.
“He tried to pick me up that day, at Lake Sam. Ted. He pulled a phony ruse to get me to his car to do something dumb, to help unload a sailboat or some other bullshit like that. I thought it was ridiculous how he was asking women to help out with manual labor. I told him Hunter was waiting for me because I knew that he was lying, especially when there wasn’t a boat—that beat‑up little Beetle could barely drag along a bicycle for god’s sake! It was a garbage rouse, terrible, but he was pretty darn attractive with those baby blues. You’ve seen him. Well, anyway, when Carol went off, I didn’t realize he’d managed to fool her, so I genuinely had no clue about where she was. I went to visit one of my toys, the blonde college dude, in the bush, and Ted was there, and so was Carol, but I couldn’t do anything—he would’ve murdered me. I struck up a bit of a friendship so that he knew I wasn’t a threat. I can’t tell the police and, clearly, I couldn’t tell you either by the way you’re reacting now. It was an unhappy coincidence. I didn’t know other people visited there. It’s not exactly the most popular hiking trail. If it were, I wouldn’t be using it.”
“You go to dinner with him as a friend?”
“Only twice now. I’ve got to keep up my end of the bargain.”
“You know, he tried to pick me up too.”
She looks at me incredulously. “No, he didn’t. You weren’t there.”

“Not on the fourteenth. The week before. He sat down next to me. He was reading a book and then asked if I’d go to dinner with him. I told him no and he left. I didn’t think about it at all until I saw you with him at Mama Barone’s.”
“You’re fucking with me.”
“No, Maris, I’m not.” I hold my wrist in place and my teeth grind involuntarily from the agony. I’m confused, I don’t understand why this is making her angry. Does she think it makes her less special that he approached me too? “I’m not fucking with you. He asked me too.”
She brakes the car to a sudden halt in front of the hospital’s emergency department, jerking me forward in my seat.
I break into a nervous sweat seeing the gray linoleum floors and bleak bare concrete walls. I panic at the sight of hospitals—the flashbacks of bones breaking, bruises on my body, contusions to my head, from before I could read, at the hands of my father and then my mother, and eventually my sister. I recall all the tears that I shed alone in the private rooms when my parents were too busy to visit me and would have the nanny attend with a homecooked meal so that I wouldn’t have to eat mystery meatloaf and stale mashed potatoes because “Caldwells never consume hospital food.” My solitary consolation would be a visit from Carol or Mrs. Greene. They’d bring games and toys and books that would be read out to me in the most soothing of tones. Mrs. Greene would hug me (if I wasn’t nursing a shattered bone) and her perfume would be warm and wonderful. Hunter would occasionally drop by with some candy and Stephen if he weren’t too busy sulking about his own life. When Maris came, my body would shudder involuntarily, flinching at the thought of another injury, but she was never mean to me in public. She’d sit with me like any good, loyal sister would and, in front of the doctors, she’d always help feed me and comb my hair, often using her own hair ribbons to make beautiful bows on my plaits. I dread hospitals. I feel nauseated, reluctant to leave the car but frightened of spending more time with Maris. She has her sweet moments—she would take care of me when I got home, fixing me large bowls of ice

cream and sneaking in Godiva gems, telling god‑awful jokes that’d make me laugh out of sheer embarrassment, and that’s the Maris that I try to remember, but recently there’s been no trace of her.
My lip trembles. The tears begin to drip again, my body seizing with fear.
“You are such a fucking baby, stop crying and go inside. They’ll patch you up and send you on your way within an hour, tops.” She offers a cruel smile, revealing the inner sadist as she does every so often. “You’re kind of a VIP now, aren’t you? They should give you a loyalty card and a stamp every time you visit.”
I open the car door with my good hand, and she gives my shoulder a little shove, pushing me out. I let out a little yelp, and she laughs. I walk in through the familiar sliding entrance for what feels like the thousandth time. Maris soon follows, which is unexpected. I thought she’d dump me outside as per usual.
“You’re coming in?”
“You act like I’m some kind of a monster, Millicent. You’re hurt, of course I’m going to help you in. I’m your sister.”
My heart is racing, and I want to run away, but I’m in too much pain to put up a fight. Maris strides confidently to the reception and triage, walking straight past the people in the queue. The nurse looks up at her, confused.
“Hi, I’m Maris Caldwell. My sister fell down some stairs, and she must be looked at urgently.” She gives the people waiting a disparaging look when they try to speak up. She drums her manicured nails against the countertop. “Is Dr. Islington in? He knows our family very well.”
“Yes, he is. I’m afraid she’s going to have to fill out some forms and wait. There’s a backlog tonight.”
“Oh, I think you’re a little bit confused, my darling.” She glances down at her name badge. “Glenda, right? I’d page Dr. Islington right now if I were you and needed to keep my job.” She smiles.

The nurse appears defiant but gets elbowed in the rib by the woman next to her, one whom I vaguely recognize as one of my previous nurses. “Just do it,” she whispers.
“Let me see what I can do,” Glenda responds tersely. She glares first at Maris and then at me but stands up and reaches for a wheelchair. I offer her an apologetic look. “You can sit down, dear.”
“Thanks, Glenda, I really appreciate you taking care of my sister,” says Maris. “Do you need me to wheel her in or are you capable of handling that job all by yourself?”
I’m angry at Maris but nearly giggle at her condescension. She’s not wrong. Glenda probably would get fired—Dr. Islington is the head physician of the emergency department and is a very good friend of Dad’s, as is the chairman of the hospital, Dr. Leonards. Maris loves toying with her inferiors.
“I can handle it, young lady. Perhaps you ought to go home to bed,” she snaps.
“I think I’ll stay here with my sister. Is it illegal to spend time with an injured sibling? I’m very concerned for her welfare. Quite frankly, you would’ve left her to wait hours and even I, with only a partial medical degree, can tell you that a broken wrist and facial welts can be quite serious and could worsen with a wait. Maybe we should call Dr. Leonards and see what he thinks.”
“We’ll get her admitted and into an x‑ray right away, Miss Caldwell,” says the other nurse, bouncing off her stool as quickly as humanly possible, ushering me into the chair. “We have your insurance details on file.”
“Thank you very much, my dear. My family will most certainly appreciate your help. What was your name again?”
“It’s Simone, Miss Caldwell. Simone Beckett.”
“Excellent, thank you, Simone. I’ll come inside with Millie to help her get settled. Nobody likes going to a hospital alone, least of all my sister.”
Glenda looks on in disgust, but I’ve come to agree with Maris. Without her, I would’ve been waiting for hours. I’m not strong enough to do what Maris does. I’d be too afraid of the
H o ne y traT R A p
253
judgment from people talking about me and wondering what they’re thinking. I would accept my fate and endure the hours in an uncomfortable bucket chair in the waiting room. I don’t use our name as an express pass through life. They wheel me into a private room with the same bland plastic curtains and squeaky floors. Another nurse greets us, and both she and Simone lift me into the bed. They’re stronger than they seem. Maris gets ready to leave as soon as I’m tucked in under a stiff cotton sheet.
“I’ll tell Mother to come and get you in the morning or call me if they let you out early. I might be awake,” she tells me as she heads out the door. I don’t know if I’m happy or sad to see her go.
“I’m in a lot of pain,” I tell the new nurse. I can cry now.
“I know, honey. What happened to you?”
“I fell down the stairs. I think my wrist is broken. My face hurts.”
“I don’t think you fell down any stairs. Are you protecting someone? A boyfriend, maybe?”
“No. I fell down some stairs.” My head feels fuzzy. I don’t know if I’m concussed or still drunk. “Can I please get some painkillers?”
“Of course, honey. I can get a line in you, and then we’ll bring in a doctor to chart some pain relief. Would you like to talk to somebody? We have a counselor here 24/7.”
“No, just some painkillers, please.”
She nods but still appears concerned. I probably would, too, if I had someone like me come in. She misses a vein twice. Maris would be ideal for this job, being good with handling needles. When the nurse finally connects an IV, she calls in a doctor, and soon the morphine floods my body, wrapping me into a cloud of comfort and steering me into a deep sleep.
I wake up groggy and disoriented. It takes me several minutes to realize where I am and why. My wrist is stiff, and when I look down, I notice that it’s been wound into a tight plaster‑cast. There’s an IV in my forearm, and I feel sickly. I reach for the
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
254
assigned bag and vomit out what feels like my entire stomach and intestines.
I try to sit up, but I feel too queasy. I wipe my mouth with a tissue and sob. My entire body is wracked with pain. There’s a sharp stinging on my face, where Maris stood on me, and my abdomen is raw and bruised. I don’t know what time it is, but there is a pool of pale light streaming in from the gap in the curtain—possibly dawn. I feel helpless. I have nobody to call. Mom wouldn’t be awake, and she certainly would not make the trip down. I don’t know if Dad is even in town. Maris will be asleep, so will Hunter and Jack. Carol would’ve come and stayed with me, day or night. I miss her soothing touch, her kind voice. I sob silently. My body is weak. I’m scared of the repercussions of going home. I know I need to tell Mom what’s happened when I get back. I need to make sure Maris isn’t in the house—she can’t know I’ve said anything. Mom would be horrified if she knew Maris played a part in Carol’s abduction. I don’t believe Maris at all—knowing her, she would’ve assisted Ted. She would have no regard for the safety or life of Carol, especially not if hers was at stake. Hell, she would give Carol up for a line of coke or a couple of Quaaludes. She would do anything to save her own hide and continue killing boys for sport. There was something between her and Ted in those woods. She was in awe of him. The vibe between them was very disturbing. I fear for the missing girls. They must’ve suffered the same fate as Carol. Raped, mutilated, murdered, and desecrated. The pain and horror they endured are unfathomable—their lives were inconsequential, less important than a sole man’s psychological gratification, and Maris is aiding and abetting this! She almost became a victim. I almost became a victim. We would’ve been dumped at Taylor Mountain with Ted violating our decapitated bodies. He is a rabid animal, attacking at any cost. Beautiful, intelligent, unique women who were now nothing more than faceless corpses. I wish I could go to Mrs. Greene and tell her what had happened to her baby. She deserves to know that her grief is justified—Carol was not safe, and she has been the victim of a voracious predator. I want her spared the H o ne y traT R A p
255
details. I don’t want her to have the same imagery of a decapitated head, with a missing eye, in her mind for the rest of her life. That’s something that I will have to live with. She deserves better. I could never subject her to that trauma. The police will be kind to Mrs. Greene. They’ll tell her no more than the bare minimum.
I buzz for a nurse. The pain is overwhelming, and I’d rather the nauseous opiates and a few more hours of hazy sleep. She relents without much fight, injecting another dose of morphine and handing over a few pills of Motrin. I reject the latter. I know I’ll throw them right back up.
When I wake up, Mom is sitting primly in one of the stiff hospital chairs beside my bed. It’s an unfamiliar sight. She fears hospitals almost more than I do, and she’s never once picked me up. I’m tender and woozy.
“They’re happy to send you home now, Millicent. They gave me a call at six this morning. Your wrist is fractured in three places but, otherwise, you’re alright. My poor darling, what happened to you?”
“Maris,” I say. It’s all the explanation she needs. She’s used to the drill.
“I’ll need to talk to her when we get home. She’s only just gone to bed.”
“No, Mom, please. You can’t talk to her. Please. I don’t know what else she’ll do to me.”
My mother sighs, fiddling with her opal and pearl necklace. “I don’t know what we’re going to do with that girl.”
“Nothing, please. Just leave it alone.”
“She can’t keep getting away with this. She’s out of control. I won’t have that in my house,” she tells me firmly. “Now get dressed so we can get you home. This place gives me the shivers. I’ve brought you a freshly ironed dress from the laundry. I didn’t want to go through your wardrobe at this ungodly hour.”
“Mom, I need a little bit of help to get the hospital gown off. My arm is killing me.”

She finally pushes her huge, round sunglasses to the top of her head, revealing her vivid honey eyes and the dark circles beneath them. There is light bruising on the top of her right cheekbone. “Millie, I’m far too tired. Call the nurse.”
I buzz for the nurse again, and she shows me the maternal nurturing I’ll never experience from Mom. I don’t think Mom even wanted kids, and I think she regrets having Maris and me. It was Dad who wanted children to carry on his legacy and company. I can’t imagine what she would’ve been like during her pregnancy. Motherhood is meant to be joyful, but it’s been far from that for her. The nurse gently slips off the gown and helps me into the rigid floral frock Mom brought for me. I don’t think it’s even mine, or if it is, I haven’t seen it in about a decade.
“Can I do anything else to help, Miss Caldwell?” the nurse asks, her tone soothing and sweet. I don’t know how she can manage to be so chipper after pulling a night shift, but I appreciate it more than she can imagine. I wish I could curl up into her arms and have her stroke my hair, the way I always wished Mother would have when I was little and lonely.
“No, that’s all, thank you,” I tell her, still groggy. My voice croaks. I want to spend the day in the safe cocoon of my bed, my door locked so no one can come in to drag me back into reality.
“Alright now, you wait here, and I’ll bring the wheelchair.”
“I’m okay to walk,” I say, but I’m unsure. I feel like my legs will give way, but I find wheelchairs terribly embarrassing. I didn’t come in needing a wheelchair, and I don’t think I need one to leave.
“It’s hospital policy. I won’t be a moment.”
My mother watches her with suspicion and envy. That caring and protective instinct isn’t something she’s ever had, and I think she wonders how others experience it. She was more than happy to dump us on a new nanny every few months when the previous one would run away. When alone with Maris and me, she did the bare minimum to care for us. Canned soups and messily braided hair. Her mother is sweet and affectionate, but I guess it missed
H o ne y traT R A p

a generation, or my mother was resentful for being forced into parenthood.
I get wheeled out to the exit, and I shiver in the frigid morning air. Mom is bundled into a butter‑soft cashmere coat and long Chanel pants. It would’ve been great if she’d had the insight to bring me something warm. She helps me into the car and waits until I’m buckled in before driving.
“I’m going to take the scenic route, and you’re going to tell me what happened to you,” she says, reaching over to turn on the heater. I’m grateful for the warmth. “Maris isn’t here, so you can talk freely for once.” She’s the most authoritative I’ve ever heard her. Normally it’s Dad who carries that power.
I hesitate to speak. My throat is sore, and my cheek is aching. I don’t think I could tell her without breaking down. The horror playing out is more than I can bear. “Nothing happened, mom. It’s one of those scuffles with Maris.”
“It looks like a little more than that, Millie. I will not drive home until you tell me, and I don’t think either of us wants to stay in here any longer than we have to.”
“I don’t know where to begin.”
“Maris is involved with what happened to Carol, isn’t she?” Her gaze sears holes into the side of my face, and I’m stunned into silence. That isn’t at all what I was expecting. I’ve never known her to be involved with or have any knowledge of Maris’s activities.
“Why do you think that?”
“I’m not as oblivious as she thinks I am. I don’t think it was a coincidence that she was around when Carol disappeared. I know what that girl is capable of. She is a heinous creature. There has always been something wrong with her.”
“She says she didn’t do anything to Carol. She was there, but she didn’t do anything.”
“You know I don’t appreciate liars.”
“Mom, I’ve had a lot of morphine, and I’m about a minute from puking. I don’t want to discuss this right now.”
“We’re not going home until you tell me.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
258
I’ve never seen her dig her heels in this intensely. She’s not often a stubborn person, despite what Maris says. She’s finicky and a perfectionist about jobs needing to be completed, but she never offers ultimatums. I want to tell her so I can go home and lie in my own bed, but I also don’t want to tell her because Maris will kill me, maybe literally. The beatings at her hands are getting more severe by the day, and the drugs aren’t helping. She’s been more volatile than I’ve ever seen.
“What do you want to know?”
“First, what she’s done to you and then what she’s done to Carol. I know she’s involved, and I will know if you’re lying.”
“Listen, I’m sick of being everyone’s punching bag. I hear crap from her and from Dad, and now you’re being horrible to me too. I’ve been in hospital all night. I don’t want to be spoken to like this. I’m sore and unwell. Please talk to me calmly. I’m not the criminal.”
“Alright, I apologize if I sounded rude. I’m frustrated with the situation, not you.”
“It’s fine.” I press the gauze against my lacerated cheek. “How much do you know?”
“I know that she’s hurt quite a few boys, and that she’s out most of the night, every night, doing god knows what with god knows who.”
I decide to omit specificities and focus on Maris’s recent activity because it’s mostly what Mom is concerned with. She’s attached to Carol, almost more than she is to Maris and me.
“She says she didn’t kill Carol. She wanted me to plant some evidence on Hunter. I’m not sure exactly what it was because I didn’t take the keepsakes and Polaroids. I followed her because I was suspicious of what she was doing. You know when Hunter hit her at the ball and that nice‑looking guy picked her up? Well, she went to dinner with him.”
“That lovely Ted? He was delightful to speak with. He didn’t look like Maris’s type at all. A little bit on the older side. He looked more your speed. I had half a mind to organize a date for the both of you.”
H o ne y traT R A p
259
“As much as I’d appreciate that Mom, he’d already tried well before then. Dating wasn’t on his mind. Ted killed Carol. He tried to pick me up the week before that, then he tried to pick up Maris an hour before Carol disappeared. Like I was saying, she went to Mama Barone’s, and he met her there. I thought it was fishy. I hid in the car, and I don’t think either of them saw me. I followed them. They both drove to Tiger Mountain…where Maris goes to do certain things that I won’t get into now.”
“Tiger Mountain? The hiking track Maris and your Father use?”
“Yes, you have to park down at the bottom and walk up. I don’t think you’ve been there.” Mom’s as unathletic as me. Maris and Dad are the fitness fanatics. I couldn’t imagine anything worse than hiking on a Sunday. I’m only there for familial obligations.
“What was Maris doing there at night? I knew she was involved.”
“She said she had nothing to do with it, but I saw her and that other blonde girl’s head.”
“What do you mean ‘the blonde girl’s head’—you don’t…”
“She was decapitated. Maris had a foot on her head. It was already decomposing, but I knew it was her, and Maris admitted it was.”
“I think I’m going to be ill,” Mom tells me. Her small hands are trembling on the steering wheel.
“You’re lucky you didn’t have to see it. I can’t stop thinking about her. I close my eyes and it’s there, again and again. Maris was laughing, too, like Ted was telling her witty jokes or something.”
“Did she see you there? Did he?”
“No, they didn’t see me, but I told her I was there, that I saw it all. That’s how I ended up in the hospital. I’m scared, Mom. I’ve never been this scared. You can’t tell her about it. I don’t know what she’ll do to me. She’s getting more violent every time. I’m in so much pain.” I inadvertently start crying again.
It’s hitting me again as the morphine wears off. The realization of what I’ve just admitted to my mother. It’s like taking a nightlight away from a kid, forcing them to acknowledge the darkness whether they’re ready or not. I prefer ignorance. Mom
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

ends up driving to the mouth of Lake Washington and does an abysmal parking job across two spaces. She leans forward against the steering wheel, placing her arms over the back of her head. I hear a few sobs. She looks even smaller than usual, her compact frame fitting neatly into the seat. Locks of her hair tumble out of her loose ballerina bun. She slips her sunglasses back on. She doesn’t like to be seen crying. Dad hates weakness and, though it took time, Mom’s learned the stronger she looks, the less likely she is to be beaten or hurt. “My daughter,” is all she says. I don’t think she’s been this devastated since the first time Maris killed. “I’m a failure.”
“Mom, please promise you won’t tell her. I’m begging you.”
“I have to tell Henry. I can’t handle this on my own. He will protect us. We will be okay.”
“He won’t believe us. Maris will come up with a story. The last time I told him, he went straight to her. She split my lip, and my arms were bruised for a week.” I’m nearing the stage of hyperventilation. If Maris finds out I’ve talked, she’ll make sure no one will hear me again. If I go to the police, my parents will go to any length to protect her and the family name. Nothing is more important than our name and reputation. A serial killer daughter involved with the Ted killings would unquestionably cause a significant drop in bookings in our hotels and a damaged profit margin. Our board of directors is quite conservative, but even the most liberal of people would be disgusted.
It’s not like I’m entirely innocent either. Maris could implicate me without any trouble. I participated in her crimes. I helped her clean up. I feigned naiveté when people questioned me. I hold her secrets. It’s what family does, but I know Mom will think less of me for not having the integrity or courage to stand up to Maris. Each killing made me sick, and the victims piled up in my head, always watching me, forcing me to concede the atrocities committed against them. I remember them every night before I sleep. Their cries for help are burned into my memory. If I hadn’t have helped, Maris wouldn’t have been able to carry out most of the crimes. I could’ve saved dozens of lives. She claims that she’s
H o ne y traT R A p
261
done many without me, but I find it doubtful. If she has, she has more reasons for Saint Peter to keep the gates shut. I’ve accepted my fate; I deserve brimstone and fire. Maris understands the concepts of guilt and culpability on a cerebral level, but she can’t process it physically like the rest of us. She doesn’t feel the same kick in the gut, the nightmares, and nausea. I can’t say the same about myself. For me, it’s crippling, no matter how hard I work to justify it. The cognitive dissonance is all‑consuming.
“Millicent, you need to stay strong and have faith in me. I’m your mother. I will protect you. Nothing will be done to you. I’ll have her put in jail if I must. She will not lay another finger on you, my precious girl. I’ve let you down before, I know, but I’ll be better this time.” She reaches over to hug me, and I try to nestle into her bony shoulder. It seems foreign and wrong. As a child, I’d have the warm embrace of chubby nannies who cared for me as if I were their own. This cold, emaciated woman feels unnatural, despite our mirror‑image visage. I extricate myself from her arms and try to control the avalanche of emotions threatening my sanity.
“Please, Mom. You don’t know what she’ll do to me.”
“Just trust me. You will be fine. We all will. She needs to face justice for what she’s doing. What did she do to you last night?”
“She socked me in the stomach, stood on my face, and broke my wrist. Well, fractured it. I don’t know, it hurts all the same. I deserved to be punished for what I did, but Carol didn’t do anything.”
“What did you do? Honey, you can’t blame yourself for what Maris does.”
“I can’t tell you. It’s so humiliating.”
She shakes her head. “Your sister is involved in murders. There isn’t much you can do to compete. I’ve already failed as a mother, and this is how I’m being punished for not wanting children.”
She’s never admitted it before. I don’t know how to react. “Can we go home?” I can’t tell her about Hunter.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
262
“Yes. Avoid Maris until I tell you it’s alright to speak to her. Barricade yourself in your room if you must. I need to talk to Henry. You’ll be okay, Millicent. She can’t do anything to you if we’re around, and we will be.”
If Maris were controlled that easily, we wouldn’t have a serial killer in the family. My tremors get worse the closer we get to the house. I can imagine her in her bedroom. Inert but awake, watching television, bingeing or starving—whatever suits her at the present stage. She could be asleep, but she rarely sleeps for more than three or four hours at any one stretch. The Benzedrine keeps her awake and productive if she doesn’t have coke, and the benzodiazepines help her sleep. I always thought the lack of a conscience would help her sleep easy. I guess not. The dread fills the pit of my stomach and slowly spreads throughout my body until I’m almost paralyzed as we pull into the driveway.
“Remember what I’ve told you,” Mom says, quiet and stern. She sets her purse down on the table on the foyer, despite never allowing me to do so (“It’s so uncouth!”) and calls for my father. It’s not a surprise that he’s not home. He’s never home.
“Go to your room. Stay there.”
I climb the stairs cautiously, making as little sound as possible. I feel settled when I don’t hear her television, but the despair soon returns when I realize she could be reading or studying for exams she doesn’t need to take for another three months unless she wants to continue her string of Ds. I want her asleep, benumbed by downers. I lock the door immediately when I get into my room. Mom’s words lend me no sense of security.
I’m happy to remain imprisoned in my little suite. I have candy bars and television. It’s comfortable as far as prisons go and a small price to pay for safety. My heart is still pounding in my chest, and the memories of Carol are making the nausea unbearable. I keep a bucket by my bed and curl up with one of my plush teddy bears. I’ve had it since I was five. It was my substitute for a security blanket. Maris has a matching one with a navy‑blue bow tie. Whenever we were subjected to physical mistreatment, we’d get new teddy bears, but I threw out every
H o ne y traT R A p
263
bear other than this one. It’s been in all the bedrooms I’ve occupied over the last seventeen years. My room feels like a haven. It’s perfectly designed and about the size of a small house. I have an unobstructed view of the immaculate gardens, tennis court, and the Olympic pool. When I need some time away but don’t want to go too far, I take the pool house. It’s on the far side of the pool, so it feels like it’s a suburb away. When it was first built, Mom and I would escape together. While she’d never been truly maternal, sometimes she and I would share chocolate‑coated almonds and read Roald Dahl storybooks, like we were in our own world. She would have her own bruises while mine were healing. Dad was too smart to bring his whores home, but Mom would know. She’d confront him each time, never taking into account the history of slaps and punches she’d received. She was brave in her own way. If I knew confronting him would result in a concussion or broken collarbone, I’d retreat into my own space and stay there.
She had the temper to rival him, but she was small and weak. She had no chance. She always refused refuge back in our grandparents’ house in England. Her father was even richer than ours and always offered to get her out of the toxic relationship, but she loved Dad more than anyone could understand. Certainly, more than I could understand. I would’ve left him after the first slap.
As his daughter, I didn’t have the same freedom. I couldn’t just leave. I was a child, vulnerable. I didn’t have a choice, but she did. If she’d left, I could’ve had a real childhood, not one filled with abuse. I had glamour and luxury but none of the love of a regular home. I’ve never experienced middle‑class life, so I can’t speak to it, but I believe I’d prefer a home in which I was cherished than one in which I was rewarded with opulent cars and handbags for my silence during abuse. I don’t think nannies and trips to Paris can take the place of doting parents. Hell, I’d be happy with mild affection. It would be strange, but it would mean something. I’ve never felt wanted by my family, but I suppose not everyone has the freedom to reach into their wallet and take out a limitless credit card. I can fly to any city in the world and my parents would be none the wiser.

You’d have to care about someone to wonder why they’re not around, and I’m in no danger of that. Perhaps Maris cares: we do have a bond, and she needs me to run errands for her. It’s a bleak existence, but one day soon I’ll be my own woman. I’ll go back to university and study child psychology, have my own practice. Fix the broken kids. Maris is going to run the hotel business anyway. Our dad would never trust me with it. I remember writing him a letter when I was ten, for Father’s Day—I told him that he was my inspiration, that I’d be good like him and wanted to achieve the greatness he had. I found the letter crumpled in the bin of his home office.
I glance out the window. The sun has made an appearance, and the skies are clear of any of Seattle’s usual clouds. It’s 10 AM. Mom had either picked me up a lot later than I thought, or we had spent a very long time in the car. I lie on my side and watch the dappled, glittering water of the pool. It is still and calming, without the waves of the ocean or water lapping in a lake. It’s an arm’s reach away, and it looks like the perfect escape. I wrap the cool, beige silk sheets around me, using two pillows to support my aching body. I wish I could talk to Carol about this, or the only other person who brings me comfort lately—Charles. Both are out of reach, held hostage by the same insatiable person.
There hasn’t been a time Maris has “allowed” me to keep a boyfriend or girlfriend. I used to date Connor (a nickname for Cornelius, which he loathed) Wilton, a sophomore at UW, for a year and a half. I saw a future with him, despite how corny that sounds, despite his questionable involvement with Phi Beta Kappa, and despite how much Maris hated him. She enjoyed having unfettered access to me, and he was getting in the way of that, so he had to go. She made sure of it. She told him that I was cheating on him, which I’d never do, and shattered his self‑esteem every time he came to the house for dinner. She always let him know he wasn’t good enough to be a part of this crappy family. She made it seem like we were the Kennedys or the Rothchilds, for god’s sake. He started to doubt himself and our relationship—he genuinely began to believe he wasn’t good enough, despite his H o ne y traT R A p

family’s investment banking background. His insecurities got the better of him, after enough Maris’s irritating jabs. She chipped away at his ability to trust me, and soon enough the relationship collapsed. She put her own relationships on hold to ensure mine dissipated.
Her determination makes her an indomitable force. I’m her property, with no more sentience or will than one of her purses. The only difference is that she’d never damage a purse. Humans are disposable to Maris, bags aren’t. She isolated me from all my friends as the only ones I have now are ones we share. Carol was the one exception, one friend I had a genuine connection with outside of Maris. She had to steal her, too, to prove she will always have the upper hand. She says she wants what’s best for me, and the answer is her. I’ve never known anyone as cruel or as kind as her.
I spend two hours in silence, staring at the pool before I get the courage to turn on the television. I freeze when I hear footsteps on the stairs. I’m grateful when they continue right past me. I know what I’ve got to do. I can’t rely on my mom’s words to ensure my safety or that of anyone else’s. Maris on her own is enough of a terror to society. I don’t know how much worse it’ll get now that she’s working with someone potentially more malicious than her. Leaking information is something that no one in the family will approve of, but it needs to be done. This matter needs to be handled by someone outside the family, not biased by the charm or ire of Maris or having to maintain the reputation of our brand. Mom says she’ll have Maris put behind bars, but she’s nothing but talk. She will never be able to convince Dad to punish her properly, to let the families of her victims know their loved ones aren’t coming home. She’ll still torture, maim and dismember in peace. I don’t think Mom understands the extent of the crimes. I’m not sure if Dad does either. I call the only person I can trust. Elaine, Carol’s mom.

CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
Millie
I’ve been staring at the ringing phone in my room for the last fifty‑one seconds. My hand trembles as I reach for it. I’m still reeling from my conversation with Elaine. I feel my throat tensing, my words choked when I answer. “Hello?”
“Millie, it’s your father. Quinn came to the hotel to let me know what’s been happening. I know you’re scared, but it’ll be alright. I can help you. I didn’t know how bad the situation had become,” he tells me, his voice tranquil and smooth. “I have back‑to‑back meetings until seven tonight, so I can’t see you until after. Please come to my office at eight, so we can decide what to do together.”
I consider it for a moment. I’m supposed to be meeting Mrs. Greene at her house. She needs to get her closure. What’s being done to her is atrocious. “I don’t think I can. Can we talk about it tomorrow?”
“Tomorrow?” he asks incredulously. “This is rather time‑sensitive, Millicent. We need something done as soon as possible. If Asahi Takahashi and his partners hadn’t flown in from Tokyo to discuss a merger, I’d come home right now. We need a plan. We’re in the middle of an emergency. You need to be here at eight.”
There’s no arguing with my father. Once he’s decided something, there’s no room for discussion. I’ve learned this 267
several ways. Mrs. Greene will understand that I’ll have to tell her all I know afterwards. She’s waited months to hear the fate of her daughter. A couple of hours is better than never knowing. There’s only so much you can say over the phone. I felt my heart shatter when I told her the bare minimum—seeing her in person is going to break me. I’ve cried more in the past few days than I have for most of my life. “That’s fine, Dad. I’ll be there at eight,” I acquiesce. “I’m worried that she’ll see me leaving.”
“Maris said she will be out with Hunter tonight. She won’t be there when you leave. You’re safe, I promise. It will just be you, me, and your mother.”
“Alright, I’ll see you at eight. Love you, Dad.”
“See you then, pumpkin.”
It’s rare for my father to use nicknames. Neither of my parents cares for them. All our interactions are sterile and lack emotion, so I feel a bit of warmth when I hear it. Mom’s word in the house doesn’t count for a lot, but Dad’s does. He has the utmost authority and with his presence and reach in the community, he probably has figured something out, maybe a punishment for Maris that won’t drag our name through the mud or affect sales with the hotels. He’s a very logical problem solver. He doesn’t care much for emotions and focuses on outcomes and resolutions. It’s one of the reasons he’s managed to expand the business around the world. There are few major cities that are without a staple of Caldwell Hotels spread across them. He did inherit the chain, but he’s taken it to levels that Grandfather wouldn’t have dreamed of. Maybe he’s at his wits end with Maris too. He’s a man with great power, but everybody has their limits. He’s spent a decade protecting her; I’ve spent the better part of my life backing her up. Maybe it’s finally my turn to experience the spotlight and have a safety net.
I feel horrible about delaying my talk with Mrs. Greene, but it comes as somewhat of a relief as I don’t know how I’ll tell her the details without collapsing in on myself. I’ve had a day to process it, and she’s had half an hour to process the partial gore I shared with her, but time doesn’t heal the merciless cruelty of

the situation. When we were younger, Maris managed to skirt the lines of justice, but I have no idea if it’d be possible to avoid the current grave that she’s dug for herself, even with the help of money and influence. I don’t know how to tell Mrs. Greene that the little girl who spent the majority of her childhood with her daughter had such an influence on her demise. Her rage would be tenfold to mine, her grief even more. If I were her, I’d get a gun and a shovel and meet Maris and Ted in a forest, alerting the police to follow close behind. One is bound to act in violence, and the other one would most certainly snitch to save their own hide. I feel the nausea rise every time I think about Carol’s decaying head, her gorgeous face disfigured and her joyful existence sucked out by unfeeling sociopaths. Beauty and trust served to be her downfall. I wish I could trade places with her.
I’m sickened knowing I actively helped someone who was destroying families, snuffing out lives for no reason other than pleasure. I believed Maris about men causing harm, but her crimes had nothing to do with that—she’s not a feminist. She doesn’t want justice for women. She wants to prove that she’s stronger, tougher, and better than men. She wants to prove herself as a woman in a world she knows is run by men. She wants to beat them at their own game. I believe Hunter did sexually assault her like she said. If she wanted her retribution, she could harm him and be done with it. She may not be able to rape organically, lacking a penis, as she puts it, but plenty of people can get around that issue with an inanimate object, one that can cause irreparable damage. Maris’s access to weapons is close to limitless. Or she could dump him.
I lay in my silk nest reading Nancy comics from 1951—the year I was born. There’s something about the strips that settles me. They’re wholesome and sweet, a fleeting idyllic escape. The evil in my world is absent in Nancy, Sluggo, and Aunt Fritzi’s. I wait for as long as I can before I have to get ready. I’m fearing every minute of the rest of the evening: seeing Dad, explaining things to him. Mom’s frantic hysteria if she’s there. The consequences of possibly turning in my twin. Telling Elaine where her daughter
