Do you always have this effect on men?” Charles whispers into my ear.
“Without fail,” I tell him, before asking the man to sit us in a beautiful little nook near the grand piano.
“I recommend the boeuf bourguignon, not a snail in sight. You do eat beef, right? You’re not one of those hippies, are you?”
“Thankfully, I’m as far from vegetarianism as possible. Melissa has tried to make me stop eating meat because she thinks it’s cruel and unfair but, look, that’s never going to happen.”
“You’re my kind of man, Charles Elderberry.” I try hard to stop myself from staring at him. All I want to do right now is sit in his lap.
“I’m happy to hear that. I thought I may be too low brow for your taste.”
“If low brow looks like you, I’m pretty happy about it.”
The waiter stops at the table with the menu and wine list. Charles pales a little when he sees the prices. This place is relatively cheap compared to the other restaurants around here, but I can imagine that most people from Ellensburg can only afford the likes of McDonald’s. I normally wouldn’t pay, but since it’s on my parents’ account, I see no problem accosting the waiter with the bill before Charles can.
“Okay,” I tell him excitedly, “I think you’d like the gruyere soufflé and the coq au vin if you’re not up for beef. All of it is wonderful, to be honest. They cook their fries in duck fat.”
“How can you eat all that junk and still have a body like that?”
“I burn the fat off by murdering and dismembering boys,” I jest, giggling when his eyes widen. I look up to the mustachioed waiter. “What’re your specials tonight?”
“We have crêpe au four, the chef recommends it,” he says after overcoming a little bout of concern at my comment.
“Okay, I think I’ll stick to the soufflé and the chicken, but he’ll have that first.” As soon as I say it, my stomach rumbles in anticipation. They flavor it right here.
“Um, can I please have the b‑be‑beauh, ugh, I mean the beef?”
“The boeuf bourguignon?” asks the waiter helpfully.

“Yeah, yeah, I think I’ll have that.”
“Jean‑Claude, could we get a bottle of Dom with that? Whichever one you recommend,” I say. I know for a fact that he’s an ugly Ukrainian who has traded his unpronounceable name for one that sounds at least mildly French if a tad cliché.
“Of course, Miss Caldwell, is there anything else you would like?” He has on his most eager smile, expecting a large tip like the one I gave a couple of weeks ago when I got absolutely tanked from a combination of red wine and dolls.
“That’s all for now, dear.” I want to slap myself when I realize how much I sound like my mother.
“I knew I wouldn’t be able to pronounce anything here,” Charles tells me in embarrassment.
“You can stop worrying now and thank me later. If we were at the restaurant you suggested, I assure you we’d be throwing our guts up tomorrow. We had guests come in from Australia and took them there because they insisted upon it, and I was sick for the whole week after.”
“Maris, I know so little about you. Tell me everything, so I can focus on something other than how good you look in that dress. I told my mother about this date, and she said you’re a major socialite. I don’t know how I’ve never seen you on TV.”
“Oh, that’s not true. I’m not a socialite. I just go to my parents’ functions whenever they force me to and model if it’s a company I like. I’m a student. I’m in med school at UW.”
“You’re in med school, how do you do it?”
“I don’t know, I love it. I’m not even enjoying these holidays. I want to be back in class as embarrassing as that sounds.”
“I want to go back to school eventually,” he says. “I’m hoping I can get a good score on the LSAT and do law at UW or at Puget Sound. I know it’s a little far‑fetched at the moment, but I think if I buckle down and save, I could probably do it.”
“Have you considered modeling?” I ask.
The waiter appears with the champagne, the bottle dripping condensation into the ice bucket. He pours a glass for me and then Charles. I smile up at him.
H o ne y traT R A p

“Modeling, what? Me? You’ve got to be kidding me.”
“Why is that so preposterous to you? You’re what, six foot one? You have excellent bone structure and beautiful eyes. You could model until you earn enough for college. They throw boys out pretty quickly anyway, so you wouldn’t have to stick around for too long.”
He scrunches his nose in disbelief. “No, I doubt it. I could never be a model. I’m not good‑looking enough.”
“Are you fishing for compliments?” I ask with a grin. I rub his leg underneath the table with my foot. “I’m happy to give them out if necessary.”
“I feel like I’m being set up here. Women usually aren’t that forthcoming with compliments.” He blushes again.
“Somehow, I don’t believe that’d be the case when it comes to you.”
“This is why you make a good socialite, all that charisma. Does it come to you naturally?”
“No, I have a false personality that I’ve carefully cultivated that, when altered slightly, is suited to different individuals,” I tell him sarcastically.
“Have you considered stand‑up comedy?”
“I think comedy is about the only thing I don’t have an aptitude for.” I pause. “Oh, I’m only kidding. I’m not that conceited, I know I suck at most things.”
“Not from what I hear.”
“Really, what else have you heard?” I lean forward.
“My mother thinks you’re a celebrity. I don’t think she’s ever been more excited about a date of mine. She doesn’t think much of Melissa. She tells me constantly I could do better, and now, finally, she seems to be happy.”
“Wow, your mother sounds terrific. I’m glad she thinks I’m a celebrity, but I hope she doesn’t get too disappointed when she finds out I’m only a moderately intelligent medical student. My sister Millie generally does more of the publicity stuff. Everyone confuses the two of us, even our parents.”
“Don’t tell me it was your sister in that Vogue piece.”

“No, that was actually me, thankfully. I wouldn’t want you to be thinking of Millicent right now.”
“Does she look exactly like you?”
I consider it for a moment, whether I should tell him things most people wouldn’t know. “I’ll tell you a little secret. She’s an inch taller than me and unless you look closely at her, you wouldn’t notice a teeny tiny crescent‑shaped birthmark on her left shoulder. That’s the only way to tell us apart.”
“My brother Chris looks almost nothing like me. He’s a blonde, and he has green eyes. I think maybe my mother cheated on my dad. The rest of us all have dark hair and blue eyes.”
“Maybe she did, that would’ve been scandalous in the fifties. How old is he?”
“He’s twenty‑one, three years younger than me, fucking pain in the ass.”
“Why’s that?”
“He’s a loose cannon. Though, I guess you could say the same about me right now, dropping out of school and all.”
While for the past half hour I’ve been fixated on Charles’s face, I look beyond him to the circular booth right at the rear of the restaurant. I see “Ted” with a diminutive brunette, whose long, thick hair overpowers her mouse‑like features. He looks sharp in a tweed coat with a bow tie, and his dark gaze scans the room.
“Oh, you’re not incompetent in the least, Charles.” I’m a little distracted when I see Ted standing up. “Will you excuse me for a moment? I need to drop into the powder room. Hopefully, my food doesn’t get here in the meantime.”
“That’s alright, I’ll stave off from mine till you get back.” He beams.
I hurry across the restaurant, toward the bathrooms where Ted is heading. I don’t know what I’m doing or what I even want to say to him. I catch him before he’s about to enter the men’s room. “Did you end up finding a pretty girl to help with your sailboat?”
He’s a little shaken but recovers quickly. “I didn’t end up going sailing at all, actually.”

“Can I still take you up on that offer? I’d love to see your boat.”
“Yeah, yeah, of course, that would be great. You said you had a boyfriend, though, right?”
“Not anymore.”
I know this nice‑looking, sweet‑talking boy was the last person to see Carol alive. I like the feeling of being around someone so much like me, despite the carnage that he most probably caused my best friend of the past two and a half or so decades. His thoroughly chewed fingernails starkly contrast his stylish, smooth outfit and expensive patent leather shoes. I don’t think he has upper‑class breeding, but he is pretending he does.
“That’s good to know,” he tells me, finally cracking a smile.
“Say, how about you call me sometime? I can have the maître d’ send over my number to you when your girlfriend goes to the powder room if you like?”
“That would be wonderful. Don’t worry, she’s not my girlfriend.”
“Okay, well, I’ll hopefully see you soon,” I tell him, doing half a wave as I head back to Charles.
He waves in return for a while, apparently forgetting he’d gotten up to go to the restroom or perhaps considering the possibility that he may have found new prey.
“You’re one lucky girl, or this is one slow restaurant,” Charles tells me with the same beautiful beam when I slide back into my seat.
“Oh, it’s not me, this is definitely a slow restaurant.” I find myself staring at his lips. “But it’s worth it, I promise.”
“I’m going to hold you to that,” he says spiritedly.
“Alright, we should at least get drunk in the meantime,” I say, pouring the bubbly amber liquid into two flutes.
“This is embarrassing, but you have no idea how badly my chest burned when I had that scotch. I can’t do the manly man thing with liquor.”
“I’m hopeful this champagne will go down a little easier, then.” I giggle against my better judgment. “I could’ve made you
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

a full French meal at home, but I figured this setting would be more like a first date, as opposed to having my family around.”
“You know how to cook a full French meal?”
“I went to cooking school for a couple of months when I was in Paris in the summer of 1970. I was never as good as those Frenchies, but the food came out pretty damn good.” I’m not being entirely honest, as I went to only one cooking class and decided to quit and smoke Gauloises outside with the French boys. I flew home soon after because I couldn’t stand the accents or Mother’s constant bitching anymore. She was so whiny there without my father. She was the one who’d taken up the cooking classes so that she could woo him with a homemade meal like a true housewife who didn’t depend on her maids. She quit shortly after I did, but neither of us confronted the other about it. She never learned how to cook as a young girl. Her father was a steel magnate who lavished her with gifts and trips and whatever else she wanted. She was the only daughter in a family of four children and was spoiled rotten Cooking wasn’t on the cards. That’s what cooks and maids were for.
“What don’t you know how to do?”
“Well, I truly suck at singing. Honestly, I could make your ears bleed quite a bit. It’s one of my favorite torture techniques.”
“Okay, I’m going to need to hear you sing when we go back to your house.”
“I don’t know if I want to torture you, though. I had better things planned.”
“Maybe we’ll stick to your plans, then. Also, I, uh, heard that you do have a boyfriend. He’s another stupidly rich boy, heir to a candy fortune. Hunter, I think?”
“You shouldn’t believe those tabloids. Everything is sensationalized. Hunter and I are just good friends—we have been since we were tiny.” I lean in closer to him, gently touching his arm. “Don’t let it slip to anyone, but I’m kind of his beard. He’s an avowed bachelor.”
“He does not look homosexual at all! What a shock.”
H o ne y traT R A p
131
“You can let your mother know if she’s the one who told you. I imagine you don’t read the tabloids.”
“No, I can’t say I do. But they certainly sound interesting.”
“They never let the truth interrupt a good story.”
The waiter arrives with our appetizers, and Charles is hesitant as he pokes at his with the wrong fork. Being raised with perfect etiquette, it’s difficult to watch. I feel the burning iron prod urging me to tell him, but I feel another not to be like my mother. She’s so pathetic that that’s one of the only things she does in life, and I can’t do it. I cut my soufflé delicately. The rupture in the center is marvelous to look at, and it tastes even better. It’s everything I like in a food item—carbs, butter and cheese. Everything my mother hates.
“Okay, I didn’t want to prove you right, but this is not at all slimy.”
“That’s a shame, I asked for extra slime on my way to the powder room.”
“I might need to start trusting your judgment. This is phenomenal.”
“I’m glad you like it. It’s the only non‑junk food I can stomach.”
“Are you a caviar kind of girl?”
“God no, it’s foul. Even the good stuff like Beluga tastes like shit. Don’t tell my parents I said that, though.”
He starts drinking his champagne slowly, reminding me that he can’t get too drunk since he needs to drive us back and doesn’t want to get caught for driving under the influence. I finish the appetizer faster than my manners would usually allow, but I have an excuse since I haven’t eaten properly all day. The only thing I’ve eaten was that bowl of cereal and besides, I know I’ll work off the calories shortly. I feel strange. I’ve never been this tongue‑tied, at least not in the past decade or so. Words generally come to me smoothly, without a second thought.
“I still can’t believe what’s been going on in Washington, with all the recent disappearances and murders,” he tells me in between bites.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

“Yes, unfortunately, it’s such a shock. I don’t remember anything this bad happening around here. This kind of stuff always happens in New York and Los Angeles and Detroit, not in Seattle.”
“There was one in Ellensburg. I didn’t really know the girl, but she was in one of my classes before I dropped out. It was some heavy shit. Her parents have been on the news constantly. It’s the wildest thing to happen over there. Nothing happens over there.”
“It’s been a bit more personal for me. My best friend Carol went missing from Lake Sam a little while ago. They think they found her remains at Taylor Mountain.”
He looks at me for a while, assessing whether I’m making another macabre joke or not. He’s flustered. “Are you serious?”
“Yeah, I was there today with my mother and hers.” I simulate mourning. He, of course, needs to see my devastation.
“And you still came out to see me?”
“Well, my parents taught me to always honor my commitments, and I don’t mean to make you conceited, but I was very much looking forward to this.”
“I really appreciate that. You have no idea how excited I was. Hmm, actually, I’m pretty sure the majority of what I was feeling was nervousness.”
“Why would you be nervous?”
“Look at you, Maris. I’m so glad that you were able to see me tonight despite what’s going on.”
“I wouldn’t have missed it.” I smile.
“Did they find out what happened to Carol?”
“They didn’t have much to go on, but I think they found skull fractures from a blunt object.”
“Do you think it’s the same guy who’s abducting those boys? I’ve never seen guys this worried for their safety. I’ve had people warning me too. Apparently, they were all tortured and killed with different methods. Some were held captive and all were decapitated, like the girls.”

“Yeah, I would assume it’s the same guy. Maybe he’s bisexual. He sounds like such a sicko,” I say.
“None of them still had their heads or fingers intact. It’s so disturbing. I wonder what he does to them.”
“Well, I hope to do forensic psychiatry, so maybe I’ll have answers for you within about a decade. It’s so depressing. I don’t know who would do these kinds of things.”
Our mains arrive, and the waiter tops up both of our drinks before Charles can refuse. “Are you enjoying your meal, Miss Caldwell?”
“Oh yes, it’s lovely. Please pay our respects to Francois if he’s cooking tonight.”
“Yes, I absolutely will.”
“Are you on a first‑name basis with all the staff here?” asks Charles light‑heartedly.
“I’m here a lot if that explains any of it away,” I say. “Okay, the more I say that, the more I wonder why I’m not obese.”
“Well, I’m guessing your exercise has something to do with that.”
“You mean the exercise that you interrupted the other day? If I’ve gained weight, it’s on you.”
“Now I’ve got that and your dad thinking I’m a serial killer lurking around your neighborhood.” He smirks.
“Well, my parents are going out of town for a while pretty soon, so you won’t have to deal with him too often.”
“Where are they going?”
“They’re opening new hotels in Colorado and Utah. I don’t know why anyone would want to open a luxury hotel in Mormonville where only the churches have money, but my parents have a habit of making bizarre decisions, so it doesn’t surprise me.”
“So, it’s just going to be you and your sister at your place?”
“Well, actually, Millie might be going to stay with some friends in Olympia, so it’ll be me and the house staff.”
“I can’t in good conscience leave you all alone with the house staff,” he tells me with his eyes lit up.

“That’s so kind of you,” I tease. “I know I need company.”
“I’m sure guys are lining up for that.”
“Girls are lining up too.” I strategically place my hand on his. This is something I do without fail.
I’ve always had a system when it comes to behavior. I find it difficult to comprehend why people do the things they do, and I’ve never understood what makes one attractive to another for friendship or dating when it comes to qualities other than physical appearance. I’m a fast learner, and I’ve been watching people and strategizing since I was a young child. I never had the same reactions as them, nor the deep, unwavering emotions that altered their behavior. I rarely feel things strongly, but I now understand how to make it seem like I do, after years of intensive personal programming. I don’t know what went awry as I was growing up. I thought eventually I would be like everyone else, but I knew there was something different about them. They would cry about silly things like their pets dying or hurting another person and their rage would be hot and irrational. I’m not a robot; I mean, I do have emotions. I get angry, I get very angry. I feel sad when I don’t receive the appreciation I deserve, and I feel adrenaline when I take party favors or have sex or finish a killing. The rage I feel, however, is cold and clear, allowing me to respond in a calculated manner—for the most part.
I came up with a system that I would use in my personal interactions with everyone around me, altering it based on circumstances or the individual in question. With boys, I always dress in a certain way and take on a flirtatious affectation because it gets me what I want. I’ll put on a nice dress that accentuates my body, often a dipped neckline or a short hemline will come into play. I wear high heels that make me look long‑legged and feminine, and jewelry that is tasteful and eye‑catching—nothing gauche. I don’t want anything taking the focus away from my face or figure. I keep my hair shiny and wear it down, so I can be coy while I speak to them. I have a mental play‑by‑play handbook telling me what to do in any possible situation with them, and
H o ne y traT R A p

I perform these tasks mechanically. I find myself at a loss at the moment, however. I don’t know whether to follow protocol or not with Charles and Ted. I don’t know what I want from them. I don’t have a set goal, and it’s making me uncomfortable.
“Well, if you have any room leftover with all of Seattle’s most eligible bachelors there, I’d love to stop by,” he says, knocking me out of reverie. I wonder how long I’ve been staring.
“You’re coming over tonight, aren’t you? You can pick a room, and I’ll be sure to save it for you.” I run my fingers gently down his arm, stopping at his wrist. I see goose bumps rise on his skin.
“If you’ll have me, of course I will. Do you think your father will be home? I’d really like to let him know I wasn’t skulking around the neighborhood looking for girls to kill,” he says, laughing.
“God, I hope not,” I say accidentally under my breath. “There’s a chance. I think he’s trying to make up for his upcoming absence by being around all the time before he leaves.”
“That’s sweet of him. My father did a runner on us before I turned five. I don’t remember him well, only that he used to curse a lot.”
“My father isn’t as much of an upstanding family man as he pretends to be. I think he was there for a total of three of our birthdays. He spends most of the time away from us. It was always the nannies and occasionally our grandparents.”
“To shitty parents,” he says, raising his glass in a toast.
I clink mine against his. “To shitty parents.”
The coq au vin is delicious, and I’m certain he’s enjoying his beef. It would be impossible not to. This time he uses the right cutlery and takes liberal sips of his drink. He’s loosened up substantially, not as awkward or hesitant in his moves. The shy confidence penetrated the surface.
“Okay, we’re having dessert, right? Please tell me you have a sweet tooth too,” he says.
“I’m very much of a savory kind of gal, but I can’t pass up an opportunity to have the crème brûlée here.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
136
Once we’re finished with our food we head outside, clambering half‑drunk into his car as the valet drives it around. He’s excited on the drive back to my place, perhaps from the champagne or the sugar in the dessert. I didn’t wave to Ted as I left but smiled at him when I realized he’d been watching me. I didn’t want to seem too conspicuous to the girlfriend he was claiming to not be dating. Charles drives at a normal speed this time, the grandmother in him left behind at the restaurant. When he pulls into the winding driveway, I notice Mother and Father’s matching Bentleys, but Millie’s Porsche is not in sight. He looks around in awe while I think of a way to elude my parents and their upcoming onslaught of questions.
“Jesus Christ, this is the fanciest house in the fanciest suburb,” he tells me, taking in the Georgian architecture and the vast, perfectly manicured lawns. I tried when I was little to get them to put in a moat at the entrance, but they shut me down fast, telling me how silly the idea was. They weren’t big on caring about our feelings. My parents aren’t the type to humor small children—perhaps the children of others but not their own.
“Does the entire population of a small nation live here?”
“I guess you could say that half of our staff members are Hispanic.”
“Will your parents mind me coming over?”
I lie through my teeth. “No, they won’t mind at all, don’t worry.”
I lead him up the driveway, struggling a little from the tipsiness and my heels and try to slide the key in as quietly as possible. I know they’re both likely to be awake. No one in my family sleeps early unless there’s a media appearance the next day, and they don’t want to look tired and ugly on television. The doorknob turns before I get to it.
“Maris, honey, I’m glad you’re finally home.” It’s Father and he’s caught off guard by the sight of Charles. “Oh, hello there, you look familiar. Have I met you before?”
“Hi sir, I’m Charles Elderberry. I don’t think we’ve officially met, but I think you saw me yesterday around that sandstone

house down the road,” he’s cheerful but very, very jittery. He extends his hand to my father.
“Yes, that’s right, I saw you near the Weston estate. I didn’t know you knew my daughter. Maris, is he in your classes?” He shakes Charles’s hand and then remembers his manners, stepping back into the foyer to allow us in. “I’m sorry, come inside.”
“We met at the hotel, Daddy. Charles thought it was terrific, just terrific. He loved the décor.”
“It’s a beautiful hotel, sir. I was very much in awe the entire time.”
I keep from sighing when my mother enters the room, her heels clicking against the marble floor to announce her arrival. “Well, hello,” she says, taken aback when she sees him. She’s flustered when she notices how attractive he is, patting her coiffed hair into place.
“Quinn, this is Charles. He’s been saying wonderful things about the new hotel.”
“I’m so glad to hear that,” she says, unprecedentedly lost for words. Her charm is usually effortless and smooth, but her speech has halted, and her cheeks are flushed. “Are you a friend of the girls?”
“Just Maris, I’m yet to meet Millie, but I’ve heard a lot about her,” he says nervously.
“Can I get you something to eat or drink, Charles?” she asks, still staring.
“No, I’m alright, thank you, Mrs. Caldwell, I appreciate that.”
“Oh, dear, you can call me Quinn. Come on inside, it’s getting chilly out,” she says, regaining her composure. “Maris, honey, I have some terrible news. I didn’t think you’d have company but—”
“What’s wrong, Mother?”
“I’m sorry that you have to hear this on your first visit here, Charles. Maris, they identified one of the bones. It was matched to Carol. There’s a small memorial service tomorrow at Sacred Heart before the police take the remains back into custody.”
“This is awful, oh my poor Carol. I’m glad we finally have some answers, though,” I lament.

“I’m so sorry to hear that, Mrs. Caldwell, uh, Quinn, I heard about the search this morning on the news,” says Charles.
“Yes, poor Carol was Maris’s best friend.”
“It must be a very difficult time for all of you. Maris, would you like me to leave? I know you might want to be alone right now.”
“No, no, absolutely not,” I say quickly, panicking at the thought of him leaving.
“You are more than welcome to stay. I’m sure Maris would appreciate the company right now, dear,” says Mother in her softest voice.
“My mother’s right, I could use the company.”
“Okay, sure, well, I’m happy to stay if that’s alright with you guys.”
“Daddy, Mother, may I be excused?” My jaw is set as I meet my mother’s eyes. It’s a statement, not a question.
“Yes, of course, sweetheart,” she allows, knowing she has no choice. Her manners are impeccable. Not once would she cause a scene in front of someone outside our immediate family.
“Come along, Charles, my room is up this way,” I say, leading him toward the stairs. I don’t have any physical contact with him in Mother and Father’s presence because I don’t want to have to answer questions about my supposed infidelity tomorrow morning. Mother seems to be rather charmed by Charles. She’s like a high school girl swooning over the quarterback. I’d perhaps consider it creepy if I didn’t need her to be lax about him staying here. He sits on the divan instead of the bed once he’s inside. I lock the door behind us.
“Are you doing okay?” he asks me.
“I’m alright, I don’t really want to think about it right now. It might be better to deal with it in the morning. Would you like a drink or are you buzzed enough for the movies?”
“I’m pretty buzzed right now. Your room is far out. It’s even better than the hotel room.”
“Now this is something I actually did design. Well, I mean, I chose the furniture, the layout wasn’t up to me like it should’ve been. Look at how swell my canopy bed is, though.”
H o ne y traT R A p

“I think my room is about a tenth of the size. Shit, how many of these rooms do you have?”
“I don’t know, I think all up there’re nine bedrooms if we’re not including the pool house which has two rooms and a bar.” I smile. “But none of that is particularly interesting. What do you feel like watching?” I kick off my heels and my feet are finally in peace. I walk to the television and my large collection of VCR tapes. I have almost every horror film made in the last decade and a smattering of comedies and dramas.
Before I get a chance to look through the tapes, I feel his hands on my shoulders. I turn around to face him and his hands travel to my waist, where he holds me tight. He doesn’t wait for me to speak. He pulls me to him and kisses me with the intensity and craving I felt the other night in the hotel room. I kiss him back and let the heat flood my body. He’s considerably taller than I am now that I’ve no longer got my heels on, so he picks me up, and I wrap my legs around him. His kisses grow almost aggressive, and he sets me down hard on the bed, my back flush against the newly changed quilt.
“You have no idea how much I wanted to do this in the hotel,” he tells me, almost breathless. He runs one hand underneath my dress and the other unzips it, forcefully pulling it off.
“It didn’t seem like it at all,” I play, yanking him to me by the collar of his shirt. I meet his eyes and I still feel jittery. I’ve slept with my fair share of attractive men, but I’m in a new league.
“Well, I hope this’ll change your mind.” He kisses me down the neck, biting a few times along the way. He delicately slides the straps of my bra over my shoulders, reaching behind me to unhook it. I feel a wave of pleasure wash over me when he looks up to grin at me, tiny crinkles about the nose, and I moan as he travels across my body with his lips. I try to take off his shirt but fall back in defeat, immobilized by pure euphoria as he goes down on me. For someone who claims to have not been with many women, he certainly knows what he’s doing. I try to keep it down, knowing that my room is far from soundproof and my parents are around, but I struggle. He brings me to climax, and
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

I expect him to be like his straight male brethren and stop right away so the focus can be shifted to him, but I’m wrong. I keep my legs around his neck and run my fingers through his tousled hair.
“Are you sure you haven’t slept with every woman in Seattle?” I ask as I gasp for breath. “I don’t know many guys who can do that after only being with one woman.”
“I guess she taught me well.” He goes back with excitement.
“Aren’t you going to let me do anything for you?” I ask. I want him to take me in missionary so we can be face‑to‑face.
“You’re having me over as a guest, that’s more than enough.”
I grab him, trying to pull him up to me. “Can you kiss me? Up here.”
The sex with Hunter is, quite frankly, lackluster. The sex with Jack is moderately better, but neither of them can make me climax regularly. They never have me in this shape, but I need sex at least once a day, and sometimes it’s a hassle trying to bring in a new person. I’m finally able to take off his shirt, and I lap up the sight of his slender, toned body. He has a tan that flouts Washington’s sullen weather, and his muscles are well‑defined. His boyishness is endearing.
“Do people tell you that you have an amazing body all the time?” he asks me in between kisses.
“All the time,” I say in jest. “Do people tell you the same?”
“Yes, all the time.” He starts laughing and slides in a second finger to make me draw in my breath.
I climb on top and kiss him while I unbutton his pants and wrestle with the zipper. I straddle him, wincing in agony as it first goes in. He grows concerned and puts his hand on my cheek before gently tucking my hair behind my ear.
“Are you alright?” he asks. “If it hurts, please tell me, we can stop.”
“I don’t want to stop,” I tell him, maintaining eye contact. I gradually ease myself down. The stabbing pain soon turns into tingles of pleasure.
He goes slow, trying not to hurt me. He’s rosy-cheeked, and his skin is lightly slick with sweat.

“Don’t worry, I’m not that fragile,” I say.
“I’m glad to hear that.” He overpowers me, pinning my arms down as he gets on top.
* * *
He’s spent when he falls asleep beside me, and I watch his long, dark eyelashes flutter as he dips in and out of dreams. I wish it were that easy for me. I’ve had insomnia for longer than I can remember. But it’s not all bad. I get a lot of work done at night, and if I need to sleep, even those four or five disjointed hours, I have access to all the benzodiazepines and barbiturates in the world. I use barbiturates sparingly. I don’t particularly want to die yet. When school is in session, I spend the nights studying anatomy and molecular structures, but when I’m on holidays I like to focus on my passions. I dexterously unwrap him from around me and pull on my lingerie, a long‑sleeved shirt, and my 32‑inch flare Lee jeans.
I skulk out of the house as quietly as possible, collecting my car keys from the bowl in the foyer. It’s past 12 AM, and I’m comforted by the dark and silence. I climb into my car, still a little intoxicated, and drive around. I love driving around, I really do. It gives me time to think, time to explore, time to plan. I normally drive for miles and miles, but I know I’ll have to be reasonably lucid by early tomorrow morning, so I go to the UW campus. It’s still quiet, with all the students having flocked back home and various tropical climates.
I stop at Dante’s Tavern, which is still lit up and filled with the less fortunate students. I don’t discriminate. I don’t care. I park further down the road, away from the crowds. I comb my hair with my fingers and rub a little cherry ChapStick onto my lips before heading inside. I sit at the bar and order a gin and tonic while I survey the crowd. They pass by, with various drunk males stopping to flirt with me.
Into my second drink, I make a discovery. In the back booth by the jukebox is a group of four boys, three with shaggy hair
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
142
and two with unsightly beards. With them is a clean‑cut, blonde all‑American type. I’m not entirely sure from here, but his eyes look green, and he’s arguably quite attractive. I have a keen eye when it comes to prey. I watch him unobtrusively for an hour until he gets up to leave. I don’t want to be seen near him or with him, so I wait as his friends disperse and trickle out the door. I pay for my drinks and follow several minutes later. He walks slowly. It’s clear he’s a bit tipsy. He walks half a mile down the street. I trail slowly behind, and he’s too drunk to realize. There’s no one else around once we’re far enough from the din of the tavern. I quicken my pace to catch up with him, careful to not make too much noise with my Salvatore Ferragamo flats.
“Excuse me, I’m so sorry to bother you,” I call out. “I’m really lost.”
He turns around, at first not sure if I’m speaking to him. “It’s cool, what do you need?”
“I can’t find my friend’s house. She said she was a couple of streets down from Dante’s, but I don’t know where it is. Do you think you could help me find it? It won’t take too long. My car is right over there.” I point at the Porsche and smile. “I’ll drop you back here.”
“Okay, yeah, sure, I can help you. I know this area well.”
“Oh, thank you so much. I’ve been struggling for half an hour.”
“Totally, no problem. Have I seen you somewhere? You look really familiar.”
“I doubt it,” I say with a forced giggle. “I just transferred here from New York.”
“I think I’d recognize a pretty girl like you,” he says as he walks drunkenly beside me.
I fumble around, pretending to struggle with the keys, giving myself enough time to unlock the door and reach under the seat for the tire iron. I drop the keys to the floor of the inside. “Oh shit, I’m so clumsy today. Do you think you could get those for me? I’m short‑sighted, and I don’t have my contacts in.” He stretches over to grab the keys, and I smash the tire iron against the base of his
H o ne y traT R A p
143
skull. He falls face-first onto the seat, and I hurriedly push the rest of his limp body inside. Luckily, Charles slept over—my alibi is airtight if the police ever catch on. I handcuff the boy’s hand to the side of the seat and drive as fast as I can, the lights turned off.

CHAPTER TEN
I return home at 4 AM and fall asleep beside a very benumbed Charles. I’d expected him to be asleep, but I didn’t expect him to be completely unresponsive. I’d ingested a nice mix of Ativan, Valium, and Xanax in the car so getting to sleep wouldn’t be a problem, but I awaken at 6:30. I lay still in bed for half an hour as I think about what to say in Carol’s eulogy. Of course I have to mention her physical beauty because that’s what’s most important to mention about a woman these days, and I need to talk about how we were friends since our infancy and how untimely her death was, yada yada yada. I wake Charles up at seven and ask him to get dressed. Mother will barge in soon or, at least, she’ll send Millie to do her bidding, and I can’t have them thinking he and I slept together. There are too many guest bedrooms to justify him staying in my room.
“Maris, are you throwing me out?” he asks, rather peppy. He smiles.
“No, of course not, I just need you to go to the bedroom next door, and I’ll come in within twenty minutes after I’ve showered.”
“I’m joshing you. I wouldn’t want your parents thinking I’m that kind of guy. I’ll be next door.” He kisses me gently on the mouth. “I know this is a really difficult time.”
“Thanks, honey, I appreciate it. I’ll come and get you soon, alright?”
Once I’ve showered, I put on a somber navy‑blue blouse with starched wing collars, a black sleeveless vest, a black pleated suede miniskirt, and a purple belt—Carol’s favorite color. I comb
145
my hair and put on mascara, but I still feel listless and imagine I look it too. I put on black stockings and a conservative pair of three‑inch heels. I still have one of Mother’s Jackie Kennedy style veiled hats, and I know she would dare not confront me about stealing it at such a tumultuous time. She comes in, as expected, to collect me, wearing a neat black Givenchy suit. It’s bland but still very flattering. I’m glad I inherited her figure.
“Maris, where is that lovely boy?” She looks me up and down. “You’ve managed to dress appropriately. Isn’t that very thoughtful of you?”
“He’s in the guest room, Mother, right next door.” I haven’t had enough sleep to tolerate her politely. “It’s my best friend’s funeral, alright? I don’t need the third degree. I couldn’t sleep all night.”
“Put on some concealer. You look like you’re the one who belongs in the casket,” she tells me coldly.
“Oh, that’s so nice of you, Mother. What a wonderful way to begin mourning. Maybe you ought to spend more time watching your weight instead of criticizing me. Your hips look like tripled in size. Please leave my room. I need to work on the eulogy.”
“Yes, well, we need to leave in thirty minutes, so don’t dawdle.”
“I hope Daddy beats the shit out of you tonight,” I whisper in her ear. “You’ve earned it.”
She’s furious but knows she can’t make a scene. The walls are thin. “You’re a nasty little bitch, you know that?” she hisses back.
“Get the fuck out of my room.”
I tower over her in my heels and use the intimidation to back her against the door. She leaves without speaking. I wouldn’t get into a physical altercation with her because I need to stay in the will, and I like picking on people my own size, unlike her. I don’t channel my anger out onto small, weak beings. It’s primarily she who’s insisted on my weekly therapy even after I turned twenty‑one. Father had relaxed considerably and thought that the shrinks were doing more harm than good. The bitch has taken accumulative weeks from me.

I stand before my mirrored wall and survey myself. I do have the dark circles Mother so crudely mentioned, but I feel the look is fitting for a funeral. I’ll have to shed a few fake tears, and the veil of my hat covers most of the damage. I’m tired and achy. I have bruises and cuts all over my arms, but thankfully my shirt has long sleeves. I know the police will be at the funeral in the hopes that the killer’s dumb enough to show up, and I don’t want their attention on me. I carry a small purple clutch and leave my room.
I knock on the guest bedroom door twice, very loudly so my parents can hear before Charles opens it. He greets me with a bemused smile, perhaps in response to the obnoxious knocking.
“You look very nice for someone who’s going to a funeral,” he tells me candidly before placing his hand on his mouth. “Oh, shit, I’m sorry.”
“That’s alright, my mother told me I look like I belong in the coffin, so that’s a nice upgrade,” I say.
“Jesus Christ.”
“I know, that woman sure is special!” I hope the sarcasm hasn’t been lost on him. “I know funerals are a bit of a buzzkill, so I’m sure you don’t want to go, but I really want to see you later if you’re around.”
“I should be heading back to Ellensburg. My brother’s coming over for dinner, and I haven’t seen him in a while. He goes to your college, actually. I could come and take you to a movie tomorrow if that works for you?”
“Give me a call tonight, and I’ll let you know what my schedule looks like tomorrow. Come on, let me walk you out at least.”
Father drives us all to the funeral in complete silence. No one’s spoken since we left the house. Millie is wearing one of Mother’s black dresses, and her hair is pulled into a small, semi‑deflated beehive. She has on a purple Hermes scarf, something she decided on only after I told her that Carol would appreciate the color scheme. Mother sits stoically in the front passenger seat. The church Carol’s mother has chosen is what she calls “small and modest,” or in other words, a dismal hovel with a choirboy‑raping H o ne y traT R A p
147
priest ready to tell us all about the ill‑conceived heaven that’s waiting for us when we pass. Mrs. Greene is even sloppier than before, without any semblance of a working mind. Her eyes are boring holes through me, and she heads over my way. Thankfully, Hunter gets to me first.
“Oh Hunter, I’m so glad you’re here. I couldn’t cope without you, I really couldn’t.” I hug him tightly, forcing my way into his arms.
“I’ve been trying to call you,” he says, his eyes either red from crying or smoking one too many doobies. “You didn’t get back to me.”
“I did, I tried to call so many times. Consuela kept telling me you were out.”
He realizes his discourtesy and says hello to Millie and my parents, his Colgate smile front and center. They give him a polite, measured greeting, and my mother finds her way over to Carol’s mother, ready with our family’s deepest condolences.
I find funerals in this type of weather totally puerile and needless. It’s too hot to wear gloves and a nice coat, and it’s too cold to wear a linen summer dress. If I died in this weather, I’d want them to drop me into a grave as soon as possible and wait until winter for a proper commemoration, accentuated with Burberry coats, Hermes leather gloves, and glamorous high heels. I note Hunter’s purple tie and wonder if someone sent out a memo of all my ideas to this band of morons.
He holds my hand firmly, leading me to the front pew, beside the others who’ve been chosen to present eulogies in front of the skull and three skeletal fragments they’re now counting as Carol. Her mother is usually as vain as she is hysterical—in other circumstances, there’s no doubt she’d be holding an open casket funeral. She was always very proud of how beautiful and alluring her daughter had been. I mean, considering how terrible both she and her husband look, it was a sheer miracle for Carol to come out as a solid seven. Dawn and Susannah are both seated in the front pew, along with Jack, Carol’s two brothers, Stephen,
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
148
and a cross‑eyed cousin from Mississippi who I’d venture was a product of incest.
We’re assembled based on our order of speeches. I’m to go third, following Mrs. Greene and her son, with Hunter and Jack right after me. I avoided Carol’s brothers for years after they approached puberty and started making advances on me, but I notice David still has a tremor in his left hand and an abominable bowl‑cut hairstyle. I lean into Hunter, using the warmth of his body to lull me into a comfortable position between consciousness and slumber. I regret not bringing the dark sunglasses that would allow me to sleep right through Mrs. Greene’s dramatics and her son’s morose thirty‑minute speech about accidentally pushing Carol down a flight of stairs when they were toddlers.
I wait my turn patiently and when the weepy eyesore is finally done, I climb the stairs to the podium. I didn’t get much of the speech done, but I’m an impromptu kind of girl anyway. I make the speech as I think about the delicious thrill of going out with her killer. I figure we both like the color cyanotic blue.
“Twenty‑three years ago, I met the girl who would go on to become my best friend, my sister, and my closest confidante. We were barely a couple of weeks old, but the bond grew as quickly as we did. Carol Marie Greene was a wonderful, gorgeous, vivacious girl who made life just that little bit better. We laughed together. She was always there when I needed to cry about a boy or about how I didn’t like the handbag my parents brought back for me from Milan.” I pause for expected bittersweet laughter. “She was there with me when no one else was, and I cherished her dearly. Carol was my world and will permanently have a place in my heart. I was envious of her beautiful brown eyes and a smile that always lit up the room.” I pause and force out a sob. I see flashes of her corpse putrefying in the wilderness, how one eye had been foraged and the other open and still in death. “I know Carol wouldn’t want us to cry or mourn her. She would want us to commemorate her brilliant life, her talents, and her charisma. She was bigger than this, she was more than a funeral could ever show. My heart aches for my loss and for that of her
H o ne y traT R A p
149
family. Carol, I know you’re watching over us, and I want you to know I’ll fight to get justice for you. I adore you and I hope you’re at peace.”
Applause breaks out in the packed church, with the women openly crying, and the men’s eyes reddening with strain. I wriggle back into my seat in the pew while Hunter clears his throat and jiggles his foot. It’s his turn, but public speaking has always frightened the living daylights out of him. It’s another reason why he’s a terrible heir to a multimillion‑dollar conglomerate corporation.
He takes the stage anxiously, flipping through a notebook in which he’s written the eulogy. I sit straight, keeping my posture in line and incredibly uncomfortable to keep from falling asleep. I glance over my shoulder at the undercover cops who look the furthest from undercover. I lean toward Jack, gesturing for his flask. He hands it to me underneath the pew, and I take a quick swig. His eyes are almost as swollen and puffy as Mrs. Greene’s. Carol’s brother is now beside me and his breath smells like raw sewage. I control the urge to retch and place my hand appropriately to cover my nose without looking uncouth. The mourners take the stage one by one until I feel like severing my carotid artery just to leave the room. They’re all saying the same things I said, but their copies are cheap and have none of my poetic flair. Jack finally bursts while up there, crying like a little bitch, slurring his words. The guilt of fucking me while dating her still seems to be there. My thoughts keep drifting back to Ted—it’s kind of impressive how he pulled off a double heist in one day, especially when there were dozens of pigs around for their annual picnic. I’m lucky to get one in a month, almost always needing Millie’s help too.
* * *
When I turned twenty, I’d decided I wanted a little distance from my parents. I didn’t want a job or anything, I mean, I didn’t want to pay for this independence, so I pleaded and cajoled and
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
150
manipulated my father into funding it. My mother was happy, very happy, to get me out of her hair and fully supported my father’s decision to buy me a small one‑bedroom cottage a couple miles from Bellevue. I’d been at the top of my class for years. In my father’s eyes, I’d earned it. I was never there for more than two or three days at a time, and I’d have help from the maids at the family house for meals, but I really enjoyed that little sliver of freedom. I had a great television set up and this cute little sofa set, very similar to Mary Tyler Moore’s apartment on the show. As long as I turned up at school, achieved high grades, and saw the shrink, I was allowed to stay there for any amount of time I decided. It came to great use when I turned twenty-one, and the urges grew stronger, though I’d tried so hard to contain them after the previous incident. After the funeral, I stop off at home to eat a sandwich and finish off the bit of cocaine I have leftover, and then head to the little cottage. The boy from last night is still tied with rope and gagged. I’ve been extra safe, using the handcuffs to keep him in place. He’s conscious and frenzied, screaming continually once he sees me.
“I’ll take the gag out if you’ll behave,” I offer charitably, hopping up on the counter opposite him. “There’s no need to be scared, honey, we all have to go sometime.”
He starts crying, weakened from the lack of food and water. He wriggles to free himself to no avail. He thrashes and kicks. Eventually, he starts nodding, agreeing to behave. Surrounded by the beautiful bushland and a lake, there’s no one around for miles to hear him. I rip the tape off and pull his underwear out of his mouth.
“Why are you doing this to me? I’ll do anything you want me to. I won’t tell the police. I won’t tell anyone. Please, I’m begging you, please let me go,” he cries.
I always enjoy watching men beg for their lives. The bravado and masculinity disappear so quickly, it’s funny how weak it is.
“I won’t hurt you, I promise.” I grin, the adrenaline knocking me out of my earlier stupor. There’s no better feeling than complete H o ne y traT R A p
151
domination and possession. He’s mine now. “Would you like a drink or something? I’m sure you’re thirsty.”
“Why are you doing this?” he asks another four times.
“Are you saying you don’t want any water? I’m not sure if I’ll want to offer it again. I’m feeling pretty generous at the moment.”
“Please, let me go. I’ll give you money.”
I pretend to be interested. “Oh, really, you’ll give me money? How much money are we talking, sweetheart?”
“I have, uh, I have $10,000 in my account right now. I’ll give you all of it if you let me go,” he begs.
“It’s a shame for you that my family earns that in well under an hour, so it doesn’t mean too much to me, but I appreciate the offer.”
“I just want to see my family, please.”
“Oh, your family will see you, I promise it’s all the same,” I say, laughing. I walk to the kitchen and retrieve my gleaming chef’s knife. I brandish it, letting it dangle before his eyes. “They’ll see every little bit of you.”
“No, please, I’m begging you, please don’t hurt me.”
“Can you make some more interesting conversation, please? You’re boring the fuck out of me and the more bored I get, the more mutilated you get.”
“Are you going to kill me?” Tears begin to run down his cheeks.
“That depends entirely on you.” I feel terrific and put on ‘Dream a little Dream of Me’ by the Mamas & Papas on the record player. “Do you like this music?”
“It’s fine, I like it,” he says, weary.
“It’s nice, isn’t it?” I home in on him, meeting his terrified green eyes. He starts thrashing as I put the knife to his throat. It gives me a real kick to watch him squirm. “Oh relax, you little bitch, I’m not killing you yet. I want to have some fun.”
“Please don’t kill me. My father has cancer, and my brother and sister can’t support the family.”
“Don’t lie to me. You don’t have a father. He left your mother a long time ago.” I use as much force as possible to gouge his thigh
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
152
with the knife. He starts screaming and screaming, so loud that my ears hurt. I pull the knife out. “See, lying to me probably isn’t going to help.”
“How the fuck did you know that?” His face is colored, wrenched with agony. “Who the fuck are you?”
“Listen, little boy, you’re not the one allowed to ask questions here.” I plunge the knife into his other thigh. He starts bleeding down the legs of the mahogany chair. “You’re not in charge.”
He screams in anguish. “WHAT DO YOU WANT?”
“Do you think screaming at me is going to help you?” I take off the purple funeral belt. “Do you want to see what happened to the last guy who spoke to me like that?”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, when you work this hard, you generally want to keep souvenirs—it’s a lot of effort, I’m telling you.”
I walk into the bedroom. It’s sparsely decorated. There’s one king‑sized bed and two bedside tables with beautiful crystal Baccarat lamps. There are three lines of shelves on two of the walls. Each shelf contains five well‑spaced human male skulls. The room is my trophy case, displaying my total thirty kills over the two-and-a-half. I like spending time here; it brings me closer to my victims, giving me a sense of permanence. While the kills only last for so long, mementos last forever. I grab the latest one, the college boy I hunted with Millie. I’d left it to decompose in the greenhouse in the garden, and thankfully the heat sped up the process, leaving only the bones. It’s in perfect condition, pardoning the giant skull fracture on one side. I show it to the blonde.
“He was at UW too.” I set it down in front of him. “I had a lot of fun with him. My sister and I took him to the woods and shot him with ketamine darts until he couldn’t walk anymore. He was almost as pathetic as you, maybe a little better.”
“Why are you doing this?” he cries. I see him wince as I position the knife to his neck again. “Do you kill people for fun?”
“It’s a shame you’ll never get a chance to kill. It’s so much fun, it really is. I love watching people beg for their lives. All that
H o ne y traT R A p
153
control, it gives me a rush, you know? I like switching it up too. I play all kinds of games with different victims. I am God.” I stick the knife into his arm and twist it. “How many do you think you could take before you die? I’m guessing, by the look of you, twenty. None of mine, so far, have been critical shots. I purposely missed your femoral and brachial arteries. These are all surface wounds.”
“I don’t know, please, just please let me go. I need a doctor. I need to see my family. I’ll do anything you want me to.”
“You’re lucky I’m in med school, then.” I pick the belt up from the floor and whip it against his bare chest. He screeches. I whip it at least a dozen times until my arm gets sore. Red indents form all over his abdomen. I carve an M into his chest for fun. “If you don’t stop blubbering, I’m going to gag you again.”
“What do you want, I’ll give you anything,” he yelps as I whip him again. His body is a bloody mess.
“I want your skull for my collection.” I fill a glass of water for him and force him to drink half of it. “But I don’t want you dead yet. Do you want the knife, the belt, or my lighter?”
“None, please, none. I’m begging you. Please have some mercy,” he beseeches. Tears begin to flood.
I pull my lighter out of my blouse pocket. I yank his underwear down. “Your friend here is going to have a bit of fun,” I say.
“NO, PLEASE, NO, NOT THERE.”
“Do you think your girlfriend will still want you without this?” I gesture at his small, limp dick. I set it alight. His body convulses in pain for several moments. I finally put it out with the rest of the water once the smell of burning flesh starts stinging my nose. I whip his pretty face with the belt, using both of my arms this time. “Would she still date you if your face were to be permanently scarred?”
“PLEASE DON’T HURT SUSAN.”
“I don’t hurt women. I don’t gain any pleasure from watching a woman in pain. Men, on the other hand…” I whip his stomach and then use the knife to run long shallow lines down his arms.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
154
“I could let you bleed out and die from hypovolemic shock, or I could put you out of your misery. What would you prefer?”
He’s sobbing hysterically. “Please let me go.”
“How would that work? You’d probably walk fifty feet, and then you’d fall over and die of sepsis. What’re you trying to achieve?”
“Just let me out of here, I’m begging you, please let me go.”
I wait for the heat to die down a little, so I don’t burn my hand. I place the knife against his dick, giving him a second to realize before I slice whatever charred remains of it off. The floor is submerged in blood. Luckily, the floor’s made of polished marble and is super easy to clean. Plus, I never have visitors here. “Do you want to wait to bleed out or do you want me to end your suffering?”
“Please let me go.” His voice is considerably weaker, faint and fading.
“All of this cardio is making me pretty hungry. Do you mind if I eat some chips?”
He lets out a feeble moan I can’t comprehend. I open a bag of Hostess salt and vinegar chips and eat while I watch him slowly slip away, leaving behind a limp, battered carcass. I finish my food before I spend an hour severing his head, fingers, and toes and then another two hours cleaning up. By the time I’m done, it’s already dark out, the sunlight waning. I take a shower and smoke a cherry‑flavored cigarette. I haven’t felt this satisfied in a long time.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
I have finally managed to get some sleep, unhindered by the presence of someone else in my bed. I haven’t been alone in bed for a while. Hunter or Jack or Heather or Lilith or someone new, recently Charles, there was always someone. I need to be fresh for class, sleeping alone offers that privilege; I’m as clear-headed as the virginal boys who vie with me for first place. I have a solid 4.0 GPA and that’s not something I’m willing to let slip. I graduated from my bachelor’s a year early; Hunter is still in his third year of his BA, and Jack, Susannah, Stephen, and Dawn are in their fourth. I always used to pick up Carol on the way because she was too nervous to drive her new car without bumping it while parking. Instead, today I’m only stopping at Hunter’s and Dawn’s. Jack has been far too emotional for me to handle. Charles phoned soon after I woke up, asking to meet me for lunch, since he has the day off, and I’m glad I have an excuse to be away from this morose, whiny group. I don’t understand why they haven’t stopped talking about it.
“Did you guys hear another boy disappeared from UW?” asks Dawn. She’s tied up her long hair, afraid that she’ll be the next to be abducted. “He was only thirty feet from his frat house.”
“Yeah, I saw it on the news,” I say, “it’s just awful. I don’t know why the task force is sitting around doing nothing at all.” I speed through a yellow traffic light.
“No one even saw anything. I hear he wasn’t reported missing for five days,” adds Hunter. “He was in my psychology class.”
156
“Hunter, do you even do psychology?” I ask. He’s notorious for dropping any subject that has a midterm and final.
“Well, I dropped it, but when I was there for two weeks, I sat right behind him. I wonder if it’s that Ted guy.”
“Who else would it be? It seems like a rather large coincidence that there’s one dumping ground,” says Dawn, with the intelligence I had no idea she possessed.
“The police are looking into the idea that there’re two killers because the modus operandi is different,” Hunter adds. “The girls were raped and strangled, and the boys have either been shot with tranquilizers or stabbed or burned or shot with a gun. I think two had their throats slit, too, and one was drowned. What’s similar is that they’ve all been beheaded, but the boys are missing their fingers and toes too.”
“Jesus, Hunter, you seem to know a little too much about this,” I say. I’m somewhat alarmed.
“Our friend died because of one of these lunatics, you should know just as much,” he says haughtily.
“Wow, you must care so much more about her because you’ve managed to read some newspapers and lifted your head to see a TV, bravo!” I stop myself from smacking him.
“I’m being safe. One of them has struck the group. Who’s to say the other killer won’t?”
“Sweetie, I assure you, you’re fine,” I say condescendingly.
“That’s what you fucking said about Carol, and now look where she is. They can’t even find her full body, for Christ’s sake,” he snaps. “They had to bury a spine and three bones.”
“Can you calm down? You’re giving me anxiety,” says Dawn from the backseat. “I tried to meditate this morning to balance my chi and bring myself to terms with my grief, but now I feel like you guys are undoing it.”
“Were you meditating with Rain and Chakra?” I ask snidely. Only Hunter picks up on my derision. For once in a long time, he grins.
“I was, but what good is it now?”
H o ne y traT R A p

I do rounds through the university roads, eventually finding parking about a mile away from my side of campus. I have approximately ten minutes to make it to the anatomy labs, put on gloves, a coat and borrow safety goggles because I forgot to bring my own.
“I’ll walk you to class,” says Hunter as I collect my textbooks from the trunk. “Dawn, where are your classes today?”
“In the Schaefer building. I’ll catch up with you guys at Dante’s later if you’re going.”
“Yeah, I’ll see you then,” I say, with no intention of meeting them if I get a better option. “Hunter, you’re going have to run me to class, I’m so fucking late. Can you carry these for me?” I dump the books into his arms before he can respond.
“Jesus, what the fuck is going on here? I haven’t seen this many pigs together in a while,” he says, gazing across campus. I only notice them when he brings it up.
“Oh my lord,” I say. I’m genuinely surprised and slightly on edge. Considering the number of them, I wonder if there’re any left to police the rest of Seattle. They’re swarming like bees on honey, but I don’t know what honey.
“Do you think someone else has gone missing?” asks Dawn in a panic.
“Based on how many there are of them, I’m pretty sure,” I say. I can’t see any cordoned off areas, and I don’t know if it’s a crime scene or not. They’re mainly crowded along frat row. “Why don’t we go and check it out?” As much as I don’t want to look suspicious, I figure it wouldn’t hurt too much to have a look. The last I recall, they don’t assume college coeds kill frat boys.
“Oh god, what if someone else is dead?” This time Dawn looks like she’s on the verge of tears. “I can’t handle this anymore. I can’t even go to class without seeing a fucking massacre.”
“Can we have a look before you start having a nervous breakdown?” I ask, speeding up my pace. There’s no evidence left as far as I remember. I know he only bled once he was in the car, but I can still feel my chest tightening. I have to remind myself that the police are inept and will find no trace of him on
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
158
campus. I made sure of that. I approach the scene cautiously, and Dawn and Hunter fall into step. While there is a bit of anxiety, I feel pretty good that all this is because of me. I have the entire King County Sherriff’s Department at my beck and call: all I need is a dead, decapitated male. I’ve always enjoyed being the center of attention. Once we’re closer, we can see the police spread out in sections finely combing the street for any spec of forensic evidence. I imagine they’re hoping for a drop of blood or an errant item of clothing with a hair conveniently tucked into it. The other cops are either drinking coffee out of Styrofoam cups or walking around the perimeter, talking loudly on their intercoms. I see John crouched down behind a car, looking underneath it.
“Excuse me, officer, could I ask what’s going on here?” asks Hunter, causing John to almost bump his head on the trunk.
“Oh, Hunter,” he says, surprised. “I’m sure you’ve been watching the news.” He crouches lower, grasping the asphalt of the road.
“Is it that guy—the one on the news?”
“Yeah, I’m afraid it’s him. You wouldn’t have seen him around, would you’ve? It seems he and Stephen were good friends,” says John.
“You’ve got to be kidding me, right?” I ask, feigning disbelief. “I can’t believe Stephen never mentioned that!”
“Miss Caldwell, you’re here too?” He squints up at me.
“Well, yes…I mean, I do study medicine here.”
“But you didn’t know the boy?”
“I don’t even know his name. He’s a pretty average looking dude,” I say. I used to have trouble talking with the police when I was younger. I’d get agitated and sometimes scared, enunciating to overcompensate. My father’s advice was always to say no more than ten words unless you were to include “I want to speak to my ‘lawyer.’” People think that being truthful will help you with the police, but it’s the easiest way to put yourself in the slammer.
“I think…I think I’ve seen him, around Stephen,” says Dawn. For once, I appreciate hearing her voice.
H o ne y traT R A p
159
John brings himself to a standing position, brushing dirt off the knees of his green uniform slacks. “Do you know anything about him?”
“No, I’ve never spoken to him. I’ve only seen him with Stephen, I think twice,” she mumbles, staring absently at the cop.
“Do any of you know where Stephen is?” asks John.
“He’d have class about now. You can catch him outside the law library most days. It’s the place with the least sun exposure,” I say. “He’s a redhead, he burns pretty quickly.” I try not to laugh at my own lame joke.
“Have you got any leads, or are more of our friends going to turn up dead?” Hunter is cold, hostile.
“Now look, we’re doing all that we can. If you can help our investigation, please do so, if not, go to class and let us do our jobs,” replies John in contempt.
“You’re not fucking doing anything. You still haven’t found out who killed Carol, which maniac is trawling through Seattle picking up college kids to mutilate and murder. Oh, and that’s assuming there’s only one, which I doubt is the case,” says Hunter through clenched teeth.
“Go on to class, boy,” says John with a southern drawl he so clearly has been suppressing. “Get out of here.”
I wonder when they’ll finally end up linking all the male victims to Stephen. He knew all of them, bar none, and most people would be able to verify that. Stephen is generally a popular dude despite his awkwardness. I selected people who would be easily tied back to him. I mean, I have standards, so I picked the attractive ones. But they all have strong connections to Stephen—it’s a lucky coincidence that Carol has one too. The police might think only one predator is using this area as a hunting ground, one killer who attacks both males and women. I know the M.O. varies significantly from the males to the girls, but the links to Stephen will add up to a strong case against him, as will all the circumstantial evidence that I’ve deftly been working on. Stephen doesn’t have an alibi for the bulk of the killings. He is an acquaintance or friend of most of them, and we all know how
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
160
likely it is for a person to be murdered or raped by those closest to them. Stranger killings are very rare.
Stephen fits the profile almost entirely, minus the terrible sketch of Ted. I hunted carefully, stalking the victims, and finding out Stephen’s schedule. I had terrible sex with him twice, which consisted of three minutes of missionary and two of cowgirl, and I made sure to rip some hair out to leave on the headless bodies. I pretended I was into that gross, kinky shit, and I never knew how much he enjoyed submitting. I kept him under surveillance for months, watching every one of his moves and everyone he interacted with.
It’s nothing personal, of course, but if I wanted to satiate my thirst to kill, there had to be a scapegoat. Hunter was a poor choice—I’m far too close to him, and I need him around to be the boyfriend, and the girls were too easy to be targets. It was between him and Jack. I knew them both quite well, so I could get away with spending a lot of time with them. It wouldn’t look suspicious to hang out with my friends. I slept with both and decided Stephen was the lesser—he’d be the one to take the brunt. He’s also very timid and is awfully afraid of authority figures, which would make him easy to intimidate into a false confession. Jack does have a mind of his own, and is reasonably intelligent, so I’m pretty sure he’d immediately know to lawyer up or stop talking. Stephen has a deep inferiority complex that anyone with an elementary education would recognize. That explains why he’s murdering these young, wealthy, conventionally attractive men with such brute force. They would always represent what he lacked—charisma, confidence, and character. Sure, he has money, but he’s never had much luck with women, at least, not before Susannah.
“Hunter, sweetie, save the anger for the killer,” I say gently, placing my hand on his arm. “I’m sure you’ll find Stephen around today, detective.”
“I’m sure we will. Take him to class.” He gestures toward Hunter.
H o ne y traT R A p
161
“I will. He’s a little upset, understandably,” I say. I can’t help but stare at the pig’s sideburns. I wish he’d do the world a favor and get rid of them. “Come on, Hunter, I’m late for class.”
“Guys, my class is on the other side of campus. I’ll see you at Dante’s later,” says Dawn, scurrying away.
Hunter walks me to class, holding my books in one hand and my arm in the other. He holds me firmly, pulling me to him as we make our way across the giant pool of cops. “Maris, are you sure you’re okay? I don’t think suppressing all your feelings about Carol is going to help. I know you feel something. I love you and I know you.”
“What do you want me to do, Hunter? Do you want me to sit down in the middle of the street and start crying? Do you want tapes of me crying at my psychiatrist’s office? She was my best friend, trust me when I say I miss her. Of course I feel for her.” I stop in front of the labs. “Now, look, I need to get inside. You know how O’Brien likes to make an example of his tardy students.”
“I love you, Maris. You’ll be coming to Dante’s after class, right?” He puts his hands on my waist and tucks my hair behind my ear. He kisses me, his lips soft from the balm he pretends not to use.
“Yeah, sure I will. I love you, too, honey.”
I rush into class and put on all I need to avert a demerit—the coat, the gloves, the eyewear. O’Brien notices I’m late but doesn’t do anything about it, for which I’m glad. Today we’re working on human hearts. Diseased hearts beside healthy ones. Without the cadavers they’d usually be contained in. I’ve read ahead. I know what congestive heart failure looks like, and I know my way around the aortic and mitral valves. I love being in the lab. I love learning about the body in such a clinical, impersonal way. It’s a way I understand. There’s a heart very likely from an obese person. It’s grossly enlarged and covered in overwhelming, sickly yellow fat. Another heart is also enlarged but not ensconced. “Can anyone tell me why this heart is enlarged?” O’Brien asks of the entire class of forty.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
162
I put my hand up first. “I would suggest severe aortic valve regurgitation that led to an overall loss of efficiency, causing the heart to overcompensate.”
“That’s perfect, Miss Caldwell—perhaps if you turned up to class on time, you’d be the best student here.” He glances over at Jennifer Nguyen, my main contender, a butch‑looking refugee from Vietnam. Her English is poor, but her study method is meticulous. She always looks awful with her flat face and frizzy black hair, but I can’t say much today: I barely even looked at the mirror when I pulled on my brown Beatles t‑shirt and olive green, wide‑flared slacks.
“Where would you make the incision to find out?” he asks.
I take the carefully presented specimen from him, placing it on the workbench. I make a small incision with a scalpel above the aorta. “Is that it?”
“It is. Good work. You just missed a demerit.”
Jennifer eyes me contemptuously. She’s assigned the iron‑loaded heart with stenosis. I’ve been studying all through summer, even while I was overseas. I know the entire syllabus for the year, and I took a particular liking to the heart, brain and pancreas. I have a deep fascination when it comes to the human body. I enjoy the clinical rounds most, though. I like visiting patients and figuring out their innards; it’s like a puzzle. I’ve always liked puzzles. For the upcoming three weeks after cardiology, I’m doing neurology and I’ve been reading up on different types of cancers and their effects on various parts of the brain. I like to know which are operable and which are inoperable and which symptoms are caused.
Jennifer may be almost at my level academically, but she couldn’t possibly have my excellent people skills. She’ll be demolished when she has to start speaking to patients. I have a nickname for most people and hers is Agent Orange. The rest of the class often calls her a chink, but I have no reason to use racial slurs against Asians. They try to engage with me, speaking with me and asking me to hang out after class, but in the academic sphere, nothing is more important than doing my
H o ne y traT R A p
163
work and getting the highest GPA. I don’t need friends here, nor do I want them. I prefer working alone, but when we partner up, I always choose Agent Orange. She’s all work, no chat and it’s great. Thankfully, today is not one of those days, but I watch her struggle with the diagnosis for the condition she’s studying.
“I’m not very sure,” she tells him and the class timidly. “It could be a number of different things.”
“Sir, do you mind if I venture a guess?” I don’t wait for his permission. “I think it’s stenosis from an overloading of iron—I think perhaps the patient resisted chelating treatment or wasn’t aware of the problem before it got out of hand.”
“Maris, you’ve earned enough brownie points for the day. Let your fellow students venture guesses. We know yours are anything but,” he tells me.
I want to smack him, but I smile politely and keep my mouth shut. At least he’s aware that I know as much as he does. He’s not exactly a fan of his female students. He’s from the old traditional school that doesn’t allow women a position outside of the kitchen. The faculty obviously wouldn’t support that view, considering how liberal it is, so his disdain is often well disguised. Agent Orange and I are two of five women in our class. I focus on the heart assigned to me—peripheral artery disease—to stop myself from critiquing everyone else’s faulty diagnoses. I take careful cuts of the muscle to neatly fix them onto slides for the microscope. I never did any units in molecular biology, but I do think it’d come in handy. I could spend all day in the lab, taking specimens of different tissues of the body. The academic sphere is one I’ve always excelled in. You don’t need to put on a façade. It’s you and the textbooks or you and the cadavers. I feel disappointed when the four‑hour lab wraps up for lunch. There’ll be clinical rotations for several hours in the evening but after my rendezvous with Charles. I get the feeling he’s about to tell me some juicy news.
“Charles, I’m over here,” I call out across the lush courtyard outside the medical labs. I smile and run toward him, trying
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
164
to pull off my lab coat in the process. My handbag is hanging off my shoulder. He’s wearing a turtleneck argyle sweater and chinos—not entirely unreasonable despite it being summer and all. He’s radiant, beautiful, but his eyes are bloodshot. “Oh no, what’s wrong?” I hug him tightly, holding him to me for several moments. His arms are limp around me.
“My brother, my brother is missing,” he says, pausing to hold back tears. “We only found out today.”
“What are you talking about?”
“Do you see all the police on campus? They’re trying to find him. He just…I don’t know, vanished. We haven’t heard from him in a week. That was one of the reasons I needed to come to Seattle.”
“The blonde boy was your brother?” I pretend to be surprised. It was very convenient that his brother Chris was also attractive and had ties with Stephen. It fit right into my plan and fed my appetite. I’ve never felt as satisfied as I did then. Most kills don’t live up to your expectations, let me tell you. They’re not worth the several‑hour cleanups. Chris, on the other hand, was perfect. He was handsome, tall and had very pretty eyes from which tears constantly trickled. He lasted for a long time. I’d kept him in the house for roughly fourteen hours, and he stayed very much conscious for most of it. I don’t like to admit it, but I tend to be quite sadistic with my kills. I enjoy the suffering and the fear the most. It gives me a thrill to watch them writhe in pain. This was definitely a case of two birds with one stone. He wasn’t my first choice, but Robert had decided to visit his folks in Spokane, and I wasn’t given much notice. I stalked and hunted and by luck came across Chris, knowing very well about his connection to both Stephen and Charles. I don’t know, maybe I’m fucked up, but I love watching Charles’s reaction. “Come on, sweetheart, let’s sit down for a minute.”
“He didn’t come home, Maris. He’s done this before, but he always comes home. He always comes home.” A tear slips down his cheek.
H o ne y traT R A p
165
“There’s nothing to suggest he won’t come home. Does he usually go hitchhiking?”
“Yeah, he does, he turned up in Portland a little while ago, but he phoned us to let us know he was okay. He has his freedom being here instead of back in Ellensburg, but he calls us weekly, and he didn’t call.”
I sit down on a bench and pull him down, too, holding his hand in mine on my lap. “We have to have faith, Charles. He could be with friends.”
“No, he wouldn’t do this to us. He knows how hysterical our mother can be. What if he’s dead like your friend? That’s what the police think.”
“What did they tell you?” I ask, stroking the back of his hand with my thumb sympathetically. “Do they know who could’ve done this if it does end up being ruled foul play?”
“They think a male, probably gay. They don’t know if it’s that Ted dude because, apparently, it’s not his M.O. I don’t even know what M.O. means.”
“Modus operandi but never mind, that’s not important here. We need to make sure your brother is okay. What was his name, again?”
“His name’s Christopher.”
“Yes, I think I remember you mentioning him to me. He’s the only blonde green‑eyed one in the family, right?”
“You remembered, yeah, that’s him. He’s a kid. He doesn’t deserve this.”
“He looks like such a cutie, he really does. I hope he’s found alive and well. With all this going on, I’m scared to even go to my clinical rotations at night. All I’ve wanted to do lately is stay home and watch The Brady Bunch to get away from this nightmare,” I tell him.
“I’ll be staying nearby, just in case—I think one of the motels downtown, so if you need company, I could do with a little of The Brady Bunch too,” he says. He grips my hand tighter.
“Don’t be ridiculous—stay at our place for a little while. I have plenty of space in my room, but if you feel more comfortable in one of the guestrooms, there are quite a few spares.”
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
166
“I couldn’t impose like that. You’ve been so wonderful.”
I would love for him to stay at my place, not just because of the pretty face and the great sex but for watching his reactions every time his brother’s face pops up on the television. It’s such a sweet thrill knowing I’m the reason for it. It’s hard to explain. I suppose it’s a little narcissistic, but they have a whole task force trying to pin me down. As long as they stay on the Stephen trail, and I have Charles or Hunter as an alibi, I’m free to do as I please. Hunter’s possessive and jealous a lot of the time, but even he couldn’t argue against giving refuge to a boy who’s just lost his kid brother. He’d look like a monster if anyone were to find that out, and Hunter couldn’t have that. His reputation is very important to him, more important than anything else. Of course, he’ll play the benevolent boyfriend, and he already dresses a little fruity, so Charles will probably continue to buy the whole gay thing. They can sleep during the night, and I often can’t, which gives me a fantastic window of time to stalk more prey.
“You are more than welcome. My parents really like you, and none of us would mind at all. In fact, I’d be really happy, and I know you’d feel more comfortable being nearby just in case the police want to speak to you,” I say. “We can watch The Brady Bunch and my favorite Mary episodes and cope with missing Carol and Chris. I’m hoping he’s alright, though. I couldn’t save my dear Carol, and I don’t wish that fate on anyone.”
“Maris, you are the sweetest girl. You don’t know how much this means to me.”
There isn’t too much of a resemblance between him and Chris. He was probably right. I imagine his mother was having an affair. Charles is taller, with better bone structure and vividly blue eyes. I don’t think I could’ve ever chosen Charles as a target because that kind of beauty doesn’t deserve to be violated. I wonder how Charles would react if he knew his brother sat tied to a chair, slowly succumbing to death while he was going down on me in my bedroom. I mean, if they ever did look into a woman being a suspect instead of some sick faggot, I could have Charles support
H o ne y traT R A p
167
my alibi against his brother. It’s such surreal perfection that I’m still surprised I’ve accomplished it.
After I met Charles, I started doing some digging. I have some friends who are pretty good with finding out information if there’s enough money in it for them. I found out plenty about his alcoholic mother and absent father. I learned about Wilhelmina and her troubles with eating disorders. Billie is beautiful and dainty. She looks very much like Charles and obviously she wasn’t going to be on my list. When I found out about Christopher, it turned out to be quite a happy coincidence. I know most people on Greek row. I’m close with many girls in Delta Omega, so I find out gossip about the most eligible frat boys. Stephen surprisingly hangs out with them on the regular, despite being mercilessly bullied by them throughout high school. Christopher was only a distant acquaintance who Stephen saw sporadically, but the odds were stacked in my favor—he had dated Susannah. The police will at least try out the theory that he was jealous of Chris. Why wouldn’t he be? He’s a skinny little ginger mess. His maternal grandparents are oil tycoons, and that was Stephen’s ticket into our lives. Otherwise, he’d be stuck outside the golden gates envying like everyone else.
“The cop told me that perhaps my friend Stephen was a friend of his, I’m surprised that I never met Chris,” I say.
“Wait, Stephen Winthrop? Is he the scrawny redheaded kid?”
“Yeah, do you know him?”
“My brother brought him back to Ellensburg, occasionally. They’re both on the fencing team.”
“Oh god, trust that loser to fence.” I catch myself quickly. “Stephen, I mean. He’s very eccentric. He’s never been one of those normal guys on the football or baseball team. When we were like ten or something, he did ballet with me, Carol and my sister.”
“Do you think he could’ve harmed Chris? I don’t know if I need to ask that considering he did ballet, but even so?”
“Well, like I said, he’s a little odd, so I don’t hang out with him too often. I think he could do something, but I wouldn’t
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
168
be certain one way or another. Maybe you should talk to the detective about it?”
“Yeah, I have to go in for an interview tomorrow morning. Can you believe they told me I could bring counsel? What the fuck would I have to hide? He’s my brother,” he says indignantly.
“They usually ask the people closest to the missing person first, to eliminate them from the suspect list. I wouldn’t be too worried about it. I doubt they think you’re involved,” I soothe. “If you want, I can ask Daddy for a lawyer.”
“Nah, I don’t think I’ll bring one. I just want to know what happened to my brother.”
He’ll find out soon enough. The scrub that I dumped his headless, mutilated body into is often frequented by overzealous hikers on Saturday mornings. I’d give it about three days to hit the newspapers and televisions. I wonder if they’ll go into gory detail or spare the public. Sensationalism sells, but disembowelment may be a little much for the weekend news.
“Wait a couple of days before you panic.” I stroke his back. “We don’t know anything yet. It’s not right to make assumptions that hurt us.” I’m hoping he’ll stay long enough to watch the breaking story with us over breakfast. It was one thing watching Mother react to Carol’s death, but it’s quite another when it’s your own flesh and blood. The theodicy would’ve been spectacular in Carol’s conservative Catholic family, but I missed it. Considering I’m one of the very few people he knows in Seattle, and that my house probably looks like the Taj Mahal to someone from Ellensburg, I think it’s likely he’ll stick around.
“I don’t understand why this happened. He never had any enemies. Who’d want to harm him?”
I think this line of reasoning is worn and pathetic. How is it that every person who goes missing or dies is suddenly a wonderful, flawless person who was well‑liked by all the people they encountered while alive? Surely, while they were in good health, they would’ve been criticized for their actions, but they gain martyr status the minute their heart stops beating. I would love to see someone on TV or a newspaper saying that the
H o ne y traT R A p
169
person who died or disappeared was a fuckwit whom everybody hated. I could respect that kind of statement. Most of the males I’ve targeted were especially vile in several ways. They were arrogant, pretentious, misogynistic, and entitled, but all I hear about them is praise. The great things they did for the community (nothing), their positive attitude toward life (non‑existent), and their devotion to their families (also absent). The glorification of murder victims in the media is truly pitiful. Posthumously they’re angels of the highest order, apparently. I suppose it has its upsides. When I’m dead, perhaps people will forget the things I’ve done, like the police when my father pulled a few strings. I’d love to die in an exciting situation. I’ve done all these boys a favor. They weren’t just old people who’d fall into death during slumber. They were part of a game, part of a mission. That’s how I’d want to go.
“I imagine if he was anything like you, he would’ve been a truly delightful guy,” I say. I hold him against my chest, running my fingers through his freshly washed hair. “They’ll find him.”
“They probably will, but dead or alive?”
“All we can do now is keep you in good company and pray.” It’s a giant struggle not to laugh. I love imitating religious zealots. If there really was a god, he’d have swooped in and stopped me before I slit the throat of a rather religious Christian boy that I found a couple of months ago. I gave him an hour to pray to his savior. His father is a reverend, and his mother does what she can around the church because she firmly believes that women only exist to serve men and can’t or shouldn’t try to lead or have initiative and drive. I wonder where Yahweh was on that day because he sure wasn’t in my cottage. “I have a good feeling that he’s alive.”
“Do you think I should talk to Stephen myself?” he asks helplessly.
It would be quite beneficial to have a public confrontation between the two of them. Stephen is generally a coward, but when he’s cornered, he acts quickly, violently. If he strikes Charles, the chances of him having assaulted or killed Chris increase K anikaANI K A B AT R A
170
exponentially. There’s already a strong shadow of doubt over our good pal Stephen. I just hope he doesn’t cause any marks on Charles’s face.
“If that might make you feel better, you definitely should go and talk to him. He’s a little unreliable and lies frequently. If you intimidate him, however, physically I mean, he probably will break down and tell you. I’d recommend getting to him as soon as you can and preferably not when Hunter is around.”
“He’s not violent, is he? Well, even if he is, I should probably confront him.”
“Oh no, he’s very timid, not violent at all,” I reassure. “If you have trouble telephone the police in King County.”
“Is he around today?”
“Yeah, he’s always around here. I’ll show you where he’ll be, and then I have to head over to the hospital for clinical rounds. I would invite you, but I doubt you want to sit in a hospital for four hours when someone you know isn’t even sick,” I say. “Look, I can’t deal with Stephen now, especially not after the whole Carol situation, but I’ll point him out. It’s a little unsettling that he knows all the people who’ve gone missing. I don’t want to think that way. He is one of my dearest friends, but I can’t help it.”
“It must be such a difficult situation for you and your friends.” He’s sympathetic.
“It is. I don’t know what to do anymore.” I slide my hand into the pocket of my slacks, using the engraved silver band I ripped off Chris’s limp finger as a thumb stone.

CHAPTER TWELVE
My favorite keepsakes are the skulls. I display them proudly in the little cottage, the only decorations I need. However, I’m not always able to go there, sometimes it’s just out of the question, so I keep smaller souvenirs at home. They sit in the walk‑in closet, in a locked drawer I’d otherwise designate as my jewelry storage. I have rings from several of the boys, settling for a bangle from the one Sikh boy I killed last year. I have other small items, too, often strips of clothing, locks of hair, and personal affectations such as glasses. It’s my prized treasure chest. I keep Polaroids of each victim in varying states of decomposition, and some that were taken moments before the murders, catching the sheer, animalistic fear in their eyes. In between kills, I enjoy nothing more than to reminisce while looking at the pictures.
When I return home from clinical rounds, my mother tells me Charles left earlier but will return for dinner. I go upstairs and see my father in my room.
“Daddy, what’re you doing?” I ask, tired and confused. “I didn’t know you were still in Seattle.”
“Are you on something at the moment?” he asks emotionlessly. “Are you high?”
“No, of course not, I was in the hospital for god’s sake. They do surprise urine checks. You can go find that out for yourself,” I respond, more defensive than I ought to be. “I’d get kicked out of the medical program.”
“Then what’s wrong with you?” he asks.
172
“Excuse me?”
“You’ve gotten Millie involved in your business. You have goddamn Polaroids in your drawer. Have you lost your mind?”
“Why are you going through my things?”
“This is my house, Maris.
“What do you want me to say, Daddy? I don’t have an explanation for you,” I say matter‑of‑factly.
“Let’s go step by step, then,” he says. His voice is calm, but the expression on his face frightens me. “When did you start again?”
“I don’t know, maybe a year ago?”
“Be honest with me, Maris.”
“I started when you bought me the cottage. I wanted the cottage to be able to do this without involving you guys.”
“Are you telling me the sessions with the psychiatrist aren’t helping at all?” He sits on the sofa opposite the four‑post bed.
“They’ve never done anything. I don’t have control over it. I tell the shrink what he wants to hear. I don’t know what else to do. I told you that it was a waste of money, but you decided to listen to the delusional, hysterical harpy downstairs,” I say coldly. “You could’ve saved that solid 10K.”
“She thought it would help you, and from what we’d been hearing, it seemed to have good results.”
“Of course it would, Daddy. That’s generally what happens when you tell people exactly what they want to hear. I wasn’t going to go to that social climbing loser and tell him about how much I enjoy killing. He wants to see me as a victim, and I let him. I’m the girl who was raped by her boyfriend and abused physically by her mother. You know that he has a moral and legal duty to report to the police if a person intends to harm themselves or someone else, right? I’d be locked up right now.”
“What are you talking about? When were you raped?”
“Hunter raped me when I was thirteen. It’s fine, honestly, I don’t give a shit about that, but I can be the raped girl the shrink wants to see. I can be the one who’s persecuted by her abusive mother. I don’t need to be the one who talks about homicidal tendencies—why would I give myself up?”

“Why the hell wouldn’t you tell me what happened?” He’s furious.
“I told mother. She told me to not mention it to anyone else because it’s embarrassing and because no one would believe it. Hunter comes from a great family. How can he be a rapist? I would just be considered a liar.” I don’t bother with fake tears. He’s never believed them, and he won’t now.
“Well, it wouldn’t be the first time Quinn had a lapse in judgment. I think we both know I didn’t marry her for her intelligence.” His face pales despite himself. He always tries to keep up the façade, and he’s much better than me at it. He’s had two decades more experience than me, but I can see he’s on the verge of tears. I don’t think anyone likes to realize their little girl has been raped, especially not by the boy you’ve devoted so much energy and resources to.
“Do you need a moment?” I ask formally. “Or can I continue?”
He covers his face with his hands for a few moments. When his hands drop, his eyes are strained and red. “Go on.”
“I tried to control it. I killed animals, like you suggested, to alleviate tension. It stopped working, and too many neighborhood pets had disappeared. I asked you for the cottage so that no evidence could be traced back here, and so that I would have a little freedom with it all. You were the one who told me morality was nothing but a man‑made cage, Daddy.” My legs ache, and I take a seat on the bed. “I involved Millie because I’m not strong enough to always do everything by myself. She needed something to do anyway. She’s a lazy good‑for‑nothing.”
“You understand that she’s as hysterical as her mother, right?” This is something he’s repeated endlessly for the last twenty years.
“Unfortunately, I am aware.”
“Did you kill Carol? I’m reminding you to be honest here because I can’t fix things if I don’t know what’s happened.”
“I don’t kill women. I know who probably killed her, though. He did approach me, about an hour before she disappeared. He asked me to help him unload his sailboat, but when we got to the
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
174
car park, he told me it was back in Issaquah. I knew something was off about him, so I didn’t go.”
“Well, I’m glad you used your brain properly for once. Quinn is getting too sloppy with you girls. Why didn’t you tell us about him?”
“What would you have been able to do?” I snap. “What do you guys ever do? Are you planning to send me to another crappy shrink?”
“All I have ever done is to try to protect you, Maris, but you’re making it very difficult for me. There’re only so many strings I can pull, and you’re digging yourself a grave.”
“Dad, firstly, you weren’t in the country—I would’ve had to speak to your wife who would’ve immediately phoned the police. Secondly, why would I want to get this guy caught? It’s his presence that’s casting doubt on mine, I wouldn’t want to fuck that up, and that’s all mother would’ve done. Thirdly, I’d rather spare Carol’s life than mine, I’m sure you’d understand.”
“I thought you’d solved this problem when you were younger. You told me you were doing fine and that you didn’t have the urges anymore.”
“Well, I guess they came back,” I say caustically.
“Don’t fucking take that tone with me, or I’ll phone the police myself.”
“No, you won’t. You care too much about your own reputation.”
“How many have you killed, Maris?”
“I don’t know, maybe thirty or thirty‑five? After a while it gets hard to keep count.”
“And, apparently, after a while you forget how to clean your own mess. Really, Maris, you keep Polaroids? Do you have some strange desire to go to jail? I just don’t understand.” He shakes his head. “Look how easy it was for me to find them. How long do you think the police would take?”
“The police haven’t been even remotely on my trail, Daddy. They think it’s a queer trying to fulfill a fantasy. They would never suspect a woman, much less a woman like me,” I say, H o ne y traT R A p
175
calmly this time. He’s not someone I can afford to piss off. “But tell me, please, why were you going through my things?”
“Your sister let me know about your little stash. I suspected that you may have been involved in the killings, but she confirmed it and led me to this treasure trove. She told me you were forcing her to help you. That, if anything, was your biggest mistake—apart from this collection, of course.”
“She’s a fucking little bitch. I do so much for her, and she can’t keep her mouth shut? She’s lucky I don’t crack her skull open,” I scream. I’m losing control and the room spins.
“I’ve told you since you were tiny that your mother and your sister are not cut out for this type of lifestyle. You and I are a different breed, a higher one, and we can only be pulled down if they’re involved. I know about your problem, and I want to help you, Maris, but you’ve got to help me. We’re a very public family. We can’t handle any more scandals. You know that.”
I fight against myself. I want to go into her room and shatter all her crystal lamps and cut holes into her designer dresses. “Well, I know now that she’s a snake.”
“I told you many times to talk to me when you’re having trouble, not to involve your sister. She came to me in a panic, crying like a child. She’s terrified of you, of what you’d do to her if she didn’t listen to you. And on a side note, I don’t want you using uncouth, unladylike language.”
“What does she think I’ll do to her? She’s my sister.”
He rubs his temples. “Maris, you’re missing the point. I need you to tell me everything, and I need you to tell your sister nothing.”
“I don’t feel anything, Daddy. I’m nothing, I feel nothing. This is the only thing that lets me experience something human. I keep the Polaroids to remind myself that I’ve been able to achieve something,” I say, trying not to cry. At this point, I’m not sure if he can tell if I’m being honest or not. For the most part, it’s true.
“You’ve achieved a lot, Maris. You’ve been in magazines. You were Miss Washington. You have a 4.0 grade average in medical school. You’ve done surprisingly well in the half marathons you’ve K anikaANI K A B AT R A
176
been in. You were the homecoming queen and valedictorian. Why do you need this?”
“I told you, I feel nothing. I was playing different characters. When I hurt these males—now let me assure you, they are not the wonderful boys the media makes them out to be—I feel a rush. I feel better.”
“While I find this utterly abhorrent, I understand it’s always been in your psyche. I did accept it when I started to assume what was happening. I need you to be careful. I know you have no regard for anyone other than yourself, and I think that can be a good trait overall—it’ll get you further in life, but I know that if you act poorly, it’ll reflect on our family name, and we can’t have that. What do I need to clean up?”
“I started two years ago, in 1972, early in the year when it was still snowing. I found this boy at college. My double majors were in Chinese and Psychology back then, remember? He was in my Chinese lectures, and he was always sitting next to me, no matter how many other seats were available. It was a rookie move, I mean lots of people had seen us sitting together, talking, and I knew Stephen occasionally went jogging in a group with him. I lured him into the cottage, I drugged him after sex and then strangled him to death while he was out cold. He didn’t fight back, and I wasn’t at all satisfied, so I thought I needed to keep doing it until I was. I mean, I panicked a little after it was done, but since I’d done it before, it wasn’t that much of a shock. I knew what to expect, but I guess it still fell short.”
“What did you do with the body?” The tension is increasing.
“I kept it there for a while, I guess. Millie came to help with the cleanup and when she went home, I dismembered it and severed the head. You know Millie is no good with blood, so I spared her that,” I say. “I gave it a gap after the first one—I wanted to avoid it as best I could, to quell that part of me. I don’t want to be some sicko. I couldn’t, though, and I caved a month later. That’s when I started bringing Millie along because it was easier. She vomited and cried a lot, but you know that Millie will do pretty much anything I tell her to.”

“There’s the issue, Maris. Well, one of the issues. Telling Millie or involving her in the crimes is not a good idea—she doesn’t have the stomach for it, and she will buckle under pressure. I hear you’ve been blackmailing her too. She told me that you’d said you would let the police know about her involvement should she turn you in. She’s very weak and untrustworthy when it comes to these things. Plus, she knows about your little stash. You might as well go announce your crimes on the fucking news for Christ’s sake.”
I’m silent for a little while, taken aback by his language and the rage in his voice. It’s not often that I feel fear, but it’s now coursing through me. I try to placate him. “Daddy, look, I’m really sorry. I didn’t want to get you involved in this addiction.”
“I need you to stop, Maris. I need you to get rid of all this evidence, neatly and permanently. I’m not asking you: I’m telling you. Even if I were a multibillionaire, I wouldn’t be able to get you out of this. Is there any other stash that I don’t know about?”
“No, Daddy, honestly, there is nothing else.” I evade divulging the information about the collection of skulls. “I would tell you.”
“You’re going to tell Millie that you’ve stopped, and you have no intention of repeating your behavior. You’re going to get rid of this evidence and let her know of that too.”
“I have a plan, and if none of this evidence gets out, I promise you that you’ll have no reason to worry. Everything I’ve done will get traced back to Stephen. He knew every victim, and he’ll have an alibi for none of the murders. I made sure to attack when I knew he’d be alone, and for other times he hung out with me, so I can sell him out easily. I’m not an idiot. I’m your daughter, remember? I’m just like you. All I’ve ever wanted is to be like you.”
A woeful smile appears. “You have.”
I confront Millie when Father leaves for his flight to Aspen. She’s in the home library, hidden on a chesterfield among the sea of mahogany wood and first edition novels. She’s curled up with an anthology of short stories by J.D. Salinger, who she only came to appreciate after I led her to his work. She’s wearing one of my
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
178
plaid miniskirts and a sleeveless mustard‑yellow turtleneck that belongs in a trashcan somewhere in Idaho. I perch on the edge of the seat, and she looks up at me, her face hiding the guilt.
“Can I ask why you’ve told Father everything?”
“I’m really sorry, Maris. I didn’t know what else to do. The police were asking questions and the only person I could think of was Dad.”
“What are you talking about?”
“The police were asking me if I knew anything. They wanted to talk to you, but you weren’t here.”
I feel my pulse quicken. “What was it regarding?”
“Him, the stupid college guy we picked up a couple of weeks ago. Apparently, he was friends with Stephen, and the cops were sniffing around.”
I can’t tell if she’s being honest or making a cruel joke to scare me. Millie is not quite as innocent as she lets on. She makes me out to be the manipulative bitch in the family, and while I’ll accept that she is less so than me, it doesn’t negate her own behavior. She often has a penchant for emotional carnage. Her academic record may not be fantastic, but she’s got a quick wit and is disturbingly cunning. She always plays second fiddle to me, but I think that’s due to her lack of assertiveness—she is very much of the passive‑aggressive persuasion. “You’re kidding, right?”
“Why would I be kidding?” She turns to look at me. “They wanted to search the house. I told them they couldn’t, and they should contact Dad, and I filled him in. They thought I was you.”
I keep a grip on the emotions that threaten to rupture. “Did they say why they wanted to search our house and not Stephen’s?”
She starts laughing when she speaks. “Got you, bitch. Don’t worry, we’re good for now.”
“I’m going to break your fucking neck if you try that again,” I tell her, my body trembling with rage.
“I was upset when you took my car out for a joyride,” she says, shrugging.

“You decide to tell Dad this because of your dented‑up shit mobile? God, you are miserable. You should’ve done a better job when you tried to slit your wrists in January. Anyone with half a brain would’ve known to cut along the radial artery, not across it. Do you want me to show you? Maybe this time you’ll do more than waste a tub full of hot water.”
Tears begin to pool in her eyes. “You’re sick, you know that? I wish the police had come around. If anyone deserves to be in jail, it’s you.”
I can’t breathe, I can’t see. I lose control of myself and smack her forcefully across the face. I knock her to the floor and put her in a chokehold while she grabs my hair. I knee her repeatedly in the stomach and hit her head against the burgundy floor several times. “I’ll kill you. I’ll break every fucking bone in your body, you worthless pile of trash!” I shove my elbow into her neck to bar her clawing at me with her long fingernails.
“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Maris,” she cries. Blood starts trickling from the head wound.
I take a deep breath and stand up, showing her mercy she doesn’t deserve. “If you try that again, I will kill you.”
“I think I need to go to a hospital,” she says, wailing.
“You’re out of your mind if you think I’m going to be doing anything to help you. You can lie here and figure out why you’re such a cunt. Oh, and if you go to Mommy or Daddy or the police, just remember how much of you they’ll find at the crime scenes.”
“I’m not going to tell anyone, I swear, Maris. Please don’t be angry,” she begs. She strains to sit up, dragging herself up by grabbing the arm of the sofa. Her lip is bruised and bleeding.
“What did you tell Dad? Tell me, or I’ll render those thousand‑dollar braces useless.”
“He already knew everything—he said I shouldn’t bother acting like I know you more than he does. I told him where you keep those little mementos.”
“Which you wouldn’t know about if you didn’t try to swipe my coke stash, right?” I stare coldly at her. “I didn’t tell you a damn thing; you’re just a dirty sneak. You knew when I’d be
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
180
away and acted then, yet you pretend I’m the only manipulative person around here.”
She starts getting fidgety like she always does under emotional pressure. While my psychiatric sessions aim to control my urges, hers are due to major depressive disorder and panic attacks, with a little bit of PTSD thrown in. She has a different psychiatrist, and my mother tends to argue that her conditions are solely due to my influence on her. She’s attempted suicide about four times. It’s terribly embarrassing.
“I don’t know how many times I can say sorry, Maris. You can keep hitting me if that makes you feel any better.”
“No, I don’t want to bruise my hands. I have company tonight,” I say.
“Yeah, Hunter told me he was coming over for dinner.”
“Who invited Hunter over? I was talking about Charles.” I don’t recall offering him a meal at the house, and I certainly don’t think it’ll be beneficial to have him around Charles, though I suppose he’s loo-loo enough to pass for gay.
“Mother invited him. She wanted to have a family dinner. I don’t know. I don’t know what the fuck that woman wants anymore. Dad isn’t even going to be around.”
“Isn’t she still worried about Daddy fucking some broad in Colorado?”
“I don’t know why she would be. She knows he will,” she says. “Floozies have always been his hobby.”
“Do you want to get blottoed before dinner?” I can’t stop picturing Father’s perfectly stocked liquor cabinet. All of his alcohol is of such a high quality that when I was drinking at parties, I was repulsed by the vile taste of their cheap drinks and nearly stopped. He has the finest wines, aged scotch, and several hundred‑dollar bottles of cognac and brandy. “We’ll clean you up a bit, too, so you can look presentable.”
“Brandy please.”
“Jesus, Millie, this isn’t 1940. Have some merlot like a normal person.”
H o ne y traT R A p

“Ooh yes, Maris, I’d much rather be some housewife with a stick up her ass drinking wine until she forgets how many women her husband is cheating on her with.”
I start laughing, I can’t help it. I’ve helped her develop a solid sense of humor. “I’ll drink to that,” I say, pouring our drinks liberally. “I wonder if Daddy’s whores have spread venereal diseases to Mother. It would explain her anger issues.”
“Doesn’t he go to those high‑class ones?”
“Even the highest‑class whores get chlamydia at least a couple of times.” I roll my eyes. “And he tells me that I’m reckless.”
Millie and I are both lightweights as, I imagine, is expected for two slender females. I need two glasses of wine to get drunk or a shot or two of spirits. Martinis generally work a little slower because the gin‑soaked olives put a little food in my stomach, slowing down the intoxication process. I’m blitzed by the time the first doorbell rings. I’ve raided Millie’s closet, so I don’t have to wear the abominable outfit I turned up to class in. I smooth my hair down, parting it in the middle, and put on what my mother calls “whore crimson”—a bright red lipstick that contrasts the aquamarine of my irises. Millie is dressed more casually at my request. I don’t particularly like being upstaged. She’s wearing a Marcia Brady inspired gradient turtleneck and faded jeans, while I’m in a very flattering evening playsuit with the right amount of casual to justify wearing it in my home.
“Oh no, Mill, you can’t wear red lipstick. That’s my look tonight,” I say when she reaches for it, slapping her hand away. I dab concealer onto her bruises as best I can and send her down to greet Hunter or Charles—whoever’s managed to show up first. They’ll see Millie, and she’s quite a vision, and then they’ll see me, like her but prettier and taller (I forced her to wear flats), and slimmer. She’s the entrée, and I’m the main course, as always. I put on a pair of six‑inch platforms and take my time to get downstairs, stumbling a little despite my best efforts.
I’m disappointed when I see it’s just Hunter. “Hello, sweetheart,” I say, giving him a brief peck on the lips. He lingers, his hand on the small of my back. I can feel Mother’s gaze boring
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

holes through my spine. I untangle myself. “It’s so good to have you here right now.”
“You look lovely tonight, Maris,” he tells me. He leans in a little closer, whispering directly in my ear. “Where’s Millie?”
“Well, you know how clumsy she can be. Remember in homeroom when she’d fall off the stool without fail every morning?”
He bursts into laughter. “Oh my god, that was far out. Every fucking morning.”
“Hunter, would you like a drink? Renata’s been quite rude not offering you anything,” says Mother, appearing beside me.
“That would be great, Mrs. C, whatever you’re having. Thank you for having me over.”
“It’s always our pleasure, dear. Maris, take his coat.”
“Give me your coat, sir,” I say sarcastically, reaching for his thin cotton jacket.
“I could get used to you calling me that.” He grins.
“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” I hang up the coat in the closet, watching the door in anticipation.
“Why didn’t you turn up at Dante’s? I half‑believed you’d disappeared too.”
“Trust me, I’m not about to disappear. I’d totally forgotten I had clinical rounds. I only got home, like, twenty minutes ago. I didn’t even know you were going to be here.”
He glances at the dinner table. “Why is the table set for five? Isn’t your dad in Aspen?”
“My friend Charles is dropping by. His brother was the one who went missing. I didn’t want him to have to suffer alone, you know. We can relate. We lost Carol.”
“What friend? I’ve never met a Charles, Maris,” he tells me.
“Is it mandatory for you to know all my friends in order to validate their existence?”
“Well, there’s no need to be so catty about it. Isn’t a guy allowed to get angry when his girl is inviting a random dude to her house for dinner?”
H o ne y traT R A p

“Hunter, give it a rest and sit down,” I say evenly, trying not to screw an ice pick into the side of his head. “Stop calling me your girl.”
He doesn’t answer, instead, finding his seat at the table beside Millie. If anyone’s going to put up with his shit, it’s her. I stand by the door and shoo the maid away, feeling a jolt when the bell finally rings. Charles’s lower middle‑class lineage is far from visible in his crisp Ralph Lauren shirt and chinos. It’s the unofficial uniform of the wealthier boys around here. Eyes still bloodshot from the tears, he falls into my waiting arms, holding me close to him. Everyone in the room stares at him before their manners and breeding kick in. Mother is far from prudish, but I can’t recall a similar reaction on her part for any other man—excluding, of course, Clint Eastwood. Charles becomes discernibly uncomfortable when even Hunter stares.
“Come on, let’s get you something to eat, you must be starving,” I say as I lead him into the formal dining room.
“Yeah, I haven’t had a thing to eat all day. Thank you so much for having me over.”
“Oh honey, don’t be silly. You’re always welcome.” I smile. “Charles, meet Millie, my sister, and Hunter. I think you’ve met my mother.”
“Have a seat, dear,” says Mother. “I’m so sorry to hear about your brother.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Caldwell, I appreciate it.” He sits beside me, and I put my hand on his knee under the table, drunkenly caressing. “This food looks wonderful.”
“I’m glad you appreciate it. I slave away all day, and my girls barely bother to even pick at it,” she lies. The only time she steps foot in the kitchen is in the morning to drink her ridiculous African tea. She makes his plate, doling out generous amounts of truffle oil‑infused mashed potatoes and grilled Moroccan lamb chops that she most certainly did not prepare.
“So, do you go to UW?” asks Hunter, barely concealing his hostility toward Charles. Maybe he finally realizes he has some
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
184
competition, however poor and insignificant as he had first imagined.
“Central Washington State in Ellensburg,” says Charles.
“How do you even know Maris, then?”
“We met at the hotel, Hunter. Why don’t you have some more wine?” I pour more merlot for him before he responds. “There are more pressing issues currently.”
“Did you watch the evening news?” asks Charles. His eyes begin to well with tears.
“No, I was doing clinical rounds. What happened?”
“Oh my lord, I did see the news,” says Millie, pale. “You don’t think it’s possible, do you?”
“What are you guys talking about?” asks Mother.
“They found a body, and they think it’s him. They don’t know right now, and the sick bastard decapitated him, so they can’t use dental records.”
I’d hoped to be with him when the news came out, but his reaction currently is more than sufficient. “What about fingerprints?”
“He cut off his fingers and toes.”
“That is disgusting. How foul can this animal be?” says Hunter, dropping his fork. “No, ‘animal’ is too nice a word.”
“I remember when Stephen was talking about amputating fingers to delay identification, he learned about it in his forensic psych subject. This guy has clearly been listening in,” says Millie without prompting.
“Does Chris have any distinguishing features like scars or anything?” I ask.
“He has a scar on his leg from a bike injury, but they won’t let me see the body yet. They’re still processing everything.” He looks up at Millie. “Stephen Winthrop?”
“Yeah, the redheaded guy, do you know him?”
“I’m wishing none of us knew him. The police mentioned him a couple of times,” I say.

“Hey, Stephen is a good guy. I’ve known him for years. I don’t know why everyone keeps talking about him,” says Hunter indignantly.
“Because he’s the only one that can be linked back to all the victims, Hunter,” I say.
“That’s conjecture,” he tells me.
“I’m surprised you even know a word that big,” I say. “Now’s not the time to be defending your good old pal. People are dead.”
“He’s your friend too, Maris. You know he has nothing at all to do with this.”
“I don’t know that and neither do you, Hunter. You went to scout meetings together. You didn’t share every thought,” I snap.
“Maris, honey,” says Mother tersely, giving me a look that only Millie and I understand as a threat.
“Of course, it was very insensitive of me. I apologize. It’s best to not speculate, innocent until proven guilty, am I right, Hunter?” I speak calmly, making him appear uncouth.
“Yes, absolutely. I don’t think it should even be brought up when we know this Ted lunatic is running around killing people. Who’s to say he isn’t the one behind all this?”
“You can bury your head in the sand all you want, Hunter.” says Millie, “His process is completely different, but I’m sure you’d know that, doing forensic psychology and all…Oh, wait, you don’t actually do any of that do you?” She pushes a portion of lamb around her plate.
“I think, perhaps, you’ve had a little too much to drink, Millicent,” says Mother, face flushed with anger.
“No, Mom, I don’t think I’ve had enough to drink. I need to be tanked to deal with your bullshit. Charles’s brother and Carol are dead, but let’s focus on Hunter’s feelings.”
“You know that’s not it, Millie. He’s our friend,” says Hunter, this time more emotional.

“What I know is that Stephen’s middle name is Theodore,” she replies. “But I’ll let you deal with your cognitive dissonance on your own.”

I safely show Charles to the better guestroom, only three doors down from me along the hallway. Since we don’t often have guests staying in our house, the floor is pretty much mine, affording me privacy on the occasions my mother doesn’t decide to stick her head in and interfere in my business. Hunter’s still throwing a snit, moody from the direct attack. Millie, however, was the aggressor, and this makes me look angelic in comparison. I’m too tired to deal with his tantrums, but I need my satiation for tonight. If I don’t have sex, I’m left with too much pent‑up energy and boredom, and that does no good for anybody, particularly those around me. I don’t want to seem too crabby in front of Charles. I’ve almost perfected the sympathetic façade. It’s a shame Charles wouldn’t be able to perform as I’d much rather be with him. I don’t really understand it. I mean, if Millie had died, I’d be upset. But it would have no effect on my activities. It’s taken me some time to realize others aren’t quite the same. Millie is very much like them. When our first cat (uniquely named Fluffy) “disappeared,” Millie was depressed for weeks, crying at least several times a day until Father became fed up and bought her another one. I didn’t tell her that I’d been the one who drowned the ragdoll at Lake Sam.
I do the usual stuff that gets Hunter hot. He resists initially out of his indignant solidarity, but his body caves when his mind does not. He undresses me without passion, and the fucking is no more personable than the term. I don’t suppose I’ve ever “made love” or any of that gooey, disgusting stuff, but I’ve definitely experienced some more ardent (even with Hunter) or at least wanton liaisons. Hate sex does a lot for me on some occasions. I make sure I get mine and then push him off—not too aggressively, of course. I can’t listen to his voice any longer; it’s making my ears H o ne y traT R A p

bleed. The last thing I need is to start an argument. When he pulls me close to him, the quilt tucked around our tangled limbs, I turn away from him.
“What, you don’t even want to cuddle anymore, Maris? I remember when you never wanted to stop.” He says it like he’s been mortally wounded.
“I need some sleep, Hunter. It’s going to be a big day tomorrow, you know that. I can’t be looking awful in the newspaper.”
“How am I preventing you from sleeping?”
“I don’t need an interrogation. Just go home,” I snap. “I’ve always hated having you sleep over here. I can’t get to sleep with you laying on me or snoring. Do you know how much Xanax I’ve had to take over the years because of you? Just fucking go home.”
His face is flushed, and it’d be funny if I weren’t trying to get to bed. “What’s wrong with you today? Are you on the rag or something?”
“Look, sweetheart, from our relationship, I do understand that you’re not at all familiar or confident with female anatomy, but menstruation is generally difficult to miss. Don’t read into something that doesn’t have meaning. I want to get some damn sleep.”
“Why are you so angry with me? What did I do?”
“Are you fucking deaf? I just told you what’s wrong. Several times. I need to get some sleep, and you know I can’t sleep with someone in the bed. If you cared enough to listen, like a good boyfriend, you would’ve left by now,” I tell him coldly, turning to face him. “Do you want me to explain it to you the way they taught us the alphabet in pre‑K?”
“You’re insane lately. First, you go ahead and blame Stephen for Carol and however many others’ deaths in front of some fucking stranger from the middle of nowhere, and then you come up here and convince me to have sex and throw a hissy fit. He’s our friend. I’m your boyfriend. I don’t understand why you’re behaving like this. It’s embarrassing, to be frank, the way you’re acting with that dude around. He’s basically homeless.”

“Hunter, if you don’t get up right now and leave, I’m going to phone the police,” I say. I’m very matter‑of‑fact about it, but I feel the rage bubbling in my chest. A wave of disgust and nausea washes over me as I meet his eyes, and I want nothing more than to claw at his face with a screwdriver.
He laughs. “You’d never call the police.”
“Why don’t you test that theory, and I’ll count to five. They’re on the lookout for a young, white male approximately six feet, attacking young women with long, dark hair parted in the center. I’m sure they’d appreciate the tip.” I smile. “One…”
“Fuck, alright, I’m going. Call me when you’re done being a nasty bitch, okay? I can’t deal with this.” He scrambles to his feet, searching unseeingly for his clothes.
“You’re going to be my date, obviously. Don’t look like shit, alright?” I ball up his shirt and hurl it at him. “I’ll be wearing purple. Wear that little purple bow tie number you have. It’s hideous, but we need to match.”
“Yeah, yeah, alright, stop being a bitch,” he says, hopping around as he pulls his pants up his legs.
“Just go and close the door behind you, I’m not getting up.”
“Don’t screw the homeless dude.” He laughs.
“He’s from Ellensburg. That doesn’t make him homeless,” I tell him. “You’re an uncultured swine.”
“Coming from the chick who thinks anyone from south of Seattle is Mexican and can be deported.”
“Get out of here, Hunter,” I say.
He grins at me, buttoning his shirt. “Even if you do screw him, I still had you first. You’ll never get that cherry back.”
“I can’t believe you still call it that. What are you, a twelve‑year‑old girl? No, wait. You’re the guy that rapes them. Silly me.”
“Who are you kidding? You know you wanted it,” he tells me huffily. “Prancing around in those little skirts.
I think he can see my distress, the rage building. He knows the manner in which it can result. I stare at him, trying to control

myself—mental images of a hot iron in my hand, ready to scald him should he linger.
I’m leaving, don’t worry.”
He finally leaves, and I toss uncomfortably in bed. I know it’s improbable that I’ll be getting any sleep tonight and that fuels my restlessness. I debate the idea in my mind, but it doesn’t take much time for me to come to a decision. I find myself walking to Charles’s bed for the night. I knock gently on the door, peeking in through the tiny crack. He wakes with little hesitation.
“Maris, is everything alright?” he asks, looking concerned.
“I didn’t mean to bother you. If you’re sleeping, I can go away.”
“I couldn’t sleep anyway, to be honest,” he tells me. “Come in, please.”
I enter his room with as little sound as possible—I don’t need Mother’s bat ears and condemnatory voice. It’d be hypocritical. I’m sure she wouldn’t waste any time if he showed the same interest in her. I can’t imagine many women resisting. I perch at the foot of the bed. “It’s hard sleeping with all this going on.”
“I can’t find a way to get to sleep. I see him asking for me, and I’m not there.”
“There’s nothing you could’ve done,” I reassure him, neglecting the fact that had Chris not been in my bed while his brother bled out and dehydrated in my cottage, or had Charles not drawn me to him at all, the boy would still very much be alive. I wouldn’t be able to describe the thrill.
“Get in, it’s cold,” he says. He lifts up the edge of the quilt. “Is it always this cold in here? Our air‑conditioner at home barely even runs at all anymore.”
“My parents should probably come to terms with the fact that we don’t need a freezer to keep cool. This is Seattle; nature does that for us at no cost.” I climb into the sheets with him. My body buzzes when his arm brushes mine. It’s the kind of giddiness I’d expected in middle school, only to be disappointed. I made up stories about my magical hook‑ups with Hunter when the other girls fawned over their sloppy, truculent two‑week boyfriends.

The stars exploding in my body were about as realistic as the possibility of snow in Jamaica. I never felt tongue‑tied like this.
“You have great parents, Maris. Your family is wonderful.” He holds my hand in both of his.
“Only when they’re not actually your family,” I tell him. It comes out rueful. “I’ve seen Daddy more in the past few days than I have in the last year. Mother won’t go away. I don’t know which is worse.”
“You look upset, I hate to see it.” He reaches for my hand. His fingertips send currents of electricity through me. His eyes meet mine for a moment before he leans in to kiss me on the mouth. His lips are sweet and gentle, the sterility of the alcohol has evanesced any lingering trace of dinner. Something wells inside me, threatening to burst. I can’t quite pinpoint it. I kiss him back, weaving my fingers through his. I hope he can’t taste the bitterness of Hunter on me.
“I’m fine, I’m just fine.” I think I mean it when I say it, surprised when a tear trickles down my cheek. I rush to wipe it away. “Honestly, I’m okay.”
“You miss Carol, don’t you?”
With that, expectation dwindles. I had built him up in my mind as a paragon of understanding, and it was silly. Why would this boy, as beautiful as he may be, happen to dramatically differ from the others? It was a fruitless hope to begin with, but I wanted to believe it. I wanted to believe maybe someone would decode me. A lousy pipedream indeed.
“Yeah, that’s what it is,” I say. I want to sob but I don’t. I keep kissing him, down his neck and along his bare chest. I don’t want him to speak anymore. He’s surprised, but ready when I tug on the waistband of his boxers.
“Maris, you don’t have to do this, you’re upset.”
“I know I don’t have to do anything. Just lie back and enjoy, it’ll keep our minds busy.” I give him a hollow smile before I go down on him with enthusiasm I wouldn’t usually fathom. The sole pleasure of another is not something I often set out to achieve, if ever, but the look on his face feels like a reward. I watch H o ne y traT R A p

as he writhes, not in pain but in desire, another thing I wouldn’t associate with a male and my happiness. His pretty eyes light up, his cheeks flush with color, and his grin is involuntary, showing teeth. His abdomen tightens under my palm, and I feel a strong, sudden twitch in his thigh.
“You’re very good at that,” he says finally, once his breath is no longer labored. “Incredible.”
“Do you really think so?”
“I’d give up food for the rest of my life if I could get that once a day.”
I laugh, surprising myself when the sound erupts from my chest. “If you play your cards right, I can be more generous than that. In the morning to wake you up and at night to help you sleep.”
“You would be the most far‑out girlfriend in the history of girlfriends,” he tells me somberly. “Fuck, I sound like a twelve‑year‑old getting his first boner.”
“Was that when you got your first boner?” I can’t control my amusement.
“No, I think I was thirteen…” He pauses. “Actually, no, I do think it was when I was twelve.”
“When did you lose your virginity?”
“Oh, this is embarrassing, really embarrassing. I was eighteen. I couldn’t manage to lose it while I was still in high school. What about you?”
“I was…a lot younger than that, but it wasn’t so much a choice per se.”
“You don’t mean rape, do you?” He looks alarmed. I find this endearing.
“No, I mean, I don’t know. I wasn’t as ready for it as I thought I was. It was all very quick. One minute I was watching a movie, the next I was bleeding.”
“It sounds like the dude was a halfwit. Do you still speak to him?”
“It’s Stephen.”
“That bastard.”

“That’s a kinder descriptor than I would’ve used.”
“If I can ask, why are you still friends with him?”
The trickle of tears turns into an unexpected, unwelcome flood. I’m bawling like a goddamn child. I feel my body shudder and become numb.
“I’m sorry, Maris, don’t cry. What’s wrong?”
“He took everything from me. He took everything, and I’m expected to be around him, smiling and happy. I can do it. I have done it. I’ve done it for years. Nobody would care enough to change a thing. I wasn’t old enough. I didn’t want it.”
“Hey, come here,” he says, holding me against his chest, his arms tight around my waist. “I care.”
“Well, my parents don’t. I told my mother, and she said I was lying, that I was an attention seeker. If I wanted attention it wouldn’t be through something as humiliating as rape or whatever you want to call it.”
“That’s horrible. I can’t believe she’d say that to you. Why would anybody lie about that?”
“I don’t know, I never understood her reasoning. Looking at Stephen makes me feel sick. I think about the bloodstains on the bed.”
“Trust me, he’ll get his. I promise you, Maris, he will. He won’t get away with all this.”
“Please don’t tell anyone what I’ve told you.”
“No, of course not. I won’t say a thing.”
“This is why I wouldn’t put this recent stuff past him. Obviously, I can’t announce it at the dinner table. Maybe he’s escalated.”
“The police won’t do anything. We might have to do it ourselves,” he tells me. The tone of his voice has changed, the undercurrent of malice is palpable.
“Honestly, I don’t think it’s time for vigilante justice yet. Hopefully, the pigs have an idea by now.”
“They’re not going to do a thing. They’re clueless. We’d be doing them a favor,” he insists.

“Do you want a criminal record? I know Stephen. You’re not going to get a confession out of him.”
“I’m not interested in his confession. I want him to suffer.”
“He’s not worth it. He should rot in prison, not you.”

CHAPTER THIRTEEN
It’s not a very long drive to Stephen’s house. At an easy cruising speed of twenty‑five miles an hour, I reach his driveway within ten minutes and park behind his embarrassing Mustang. A boy who looks like Stephen doesn’t belong in a Mustang. I reapply a coat of lip gloss and adjust my mid‑thigh length plaid skirt before climbing out of the car. I can hear The Spinners blasting from his radio. I ring his doorbell, waiting with patience for several moments before he gets to the door.
He’s surprised, but it’s to be expected. I didn’t give him forewarning. “Hey, Maris, I didn’t know you were dropping by. What’s up?” His hair is wet and slicked back, presumably from a recent shower. He’s haphazardly dressed in a white crew‑neck t‑shirt and tropical patterned shorts. There’s a little disdain but also some excitement in his facial expression.
“I wanted to see you. We haven’t had much time to catch up lately.” I smile at him. “Am I allowed in?”
He steps back. “Of course. I’m sorry for being rude. Come on in. Do you want me to hang up your purse?”
“No, that’s alright. Are your parents at home?”
“I think my mom is out getting her hair and shit done for the benefit your folks are throwing tonight. I don’t know where Dad is.”
I appraise him, apart from his clown shorts, he doesn’t look too bad. “And Susannah, is she here?”
He laughs. “Why, are you getting bored of Hunter?”
“Is she here?”
195
“She’s not. Can I get you something to drink or eat?”
I adjust my skirt again, this time so he can see the lace band of my thigh‑high stockings. “I’m not hungry, don’t worry. Can we talk?”
When he realizes that he’s been looking for too long, his eyes meet mine again. “Sure, come on up to my room.”
I follow him up the stairs. While Hunter’s room is meticulously clean and structured, Stephen’s is in utter disarray. Hunter’s compulsive in his cleanliness and is germophobic to a disturbing degree, but Stephen’s gone too far in the opposite direction. I sit on the edge of his unmade bed, wondering how long it’s been since he’s changed his grubby‑looking sheets. With reluctance, I place my purse on the carpet. “I really have missed you, Stephen. We’ve had no time to speak, at least not in private. It’s terrible.”
“I’ve missed you, too, Maris. I’ve heard some stuff, though. I don’t know if it’s true, but I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt since I’ve known you so long. I didn’t want to believe it.”
“What have you heard, Stephen?”
“Some of our friends,” he coughs, choking on his words, “have told me that you’d told them it was me who hurt Carol and the other girls.”
“I hope you don’t believe that, Stephen,” I say, feigning shock. “I could never do that. All I said was that you knew some of the people, not that you’d been the one who hurt them.”
“I didn’t want to believe it. It didn’t seem like something you would do. That’s not the Maris I know.”
“Who said it?” I ask. “If it was Hunter, I think it may be because I was complimenting you. You know how jealous he gets sometimes.”
“I shouldn’t say.”
“Oh, come on, Stephen, we’re closer than that, aren’t we?” I place my hand on his when he sits beside me on the bed.
He studies my face and a smile appears. “We are. Yeah, it was Hunter.”

“I think he knows I’ve always been a little interested in you. It upsets him. Don’t get me wrong—I love Hunter. He means very much to me. But I’ve admired you too.”
“Are you playing me, Maris? Look at you, why would you be interested in me? You have a perfect boyfriend.”
“It sounds like you have more feelings for him than I do. Is there something you’re not telling me? Don’t tell me you’ve gone fruity.”
“No, of course not,” he says, flustered. “He’s my friend and Susannah is yours.”
“I don’t know, Stephen, it sounds like you and Hunter have a little something going on,” I joke, grinning. I edge a little closer, wishing I’d worn a lower cut top.
“I don’t believe you’d want me while you have someone like Hunter.”
“Maybe you’re better looking than Hunter. Maybe you’re smarter or funnier than Hunter. There are so many reasons. You’d see them if you stopped hating on yourself. I can’t believe you haven’t noticed that I’m sweet on you. What did you think was happening when we had sex last time?”
“I thought you were just angry at Hunter, and no one else was around.”
“There’s always someone else around.” I take off my gloves, placing them on the matching purse. I grab him by the waist and pull him to me, kissing him. He doesn’t resist. I lean back. “Does that seem like something I’d do if I didn’t like you?”
His cheeks are red. “No.”
He leans in this time, pushing me down onto the bed.
“You’re sure Susannah isn’t coming over?” I ask.
“I’m meeting her there.”
“Perfect,” I say, trying not to tremble when his fingers trace along my inner thigh, the most ticklish spot on my body. “I like having you to myself.”
He undresses me with extra care, relishing each second of it, and leaves my stockings on.
“Do you like them?” I ask.
H o ne y traT R A p
197
“You have no idea how much.” I do. It’s why I wore them.
He kisses almost every square inch of my body with such vigor that I believe Susannah has been starving him of sex for an incredibly long time. I show the same enthusiasm, straddling him. He may be misogynistic in public, but in private he loves a woman being in control. “You’re so perfect,” I tell him with a smile.
“You’re fucking with my head, Maris.”
“I wouldn’t do that to you. You know that.”
“You never show it in public.”
“Do you want Susannah to punch me or Hunter to dump me?”
“Well, maybe the latter.”
“Just enjoy the moment, Stephen, don’t make things complicated.” I lean down and chew gently on his earlobe. I’m grateful he doesn’t like to take control; I would get no satisfaction. He doesn’t quite understand female anatomy, and last time it felt like he was furiously trying to press an elevator button. I don’t orgasm, but he does.
“I’m actually pretty thirsty now. You’ve worn me out,” I say. “Do you think you could grab me a Coke?”
“Yeah, of course. I’ll go get one,” he says, pulling his shorts back on.
“Thanks, sweetheart.”
The second he disappears through the door, I rush to my bag, putting my gloves on. I place several Polaroids and Chris’s keychain under the mattress of his bed, tucking them in safely so they can’t slip if there’s a little motion on the bed. I place the rest of the Polaroids and the cracked hyoid bone of one of the boys in the hidden cupboard within his unused window seat. I’d made sure to wipe my prints off each item, and I’m glad he didn’t question my weather‑inappropriate gloves. I wasn’t going to undo all the work I’d put in with a little sloppiness. I take my gloves off as fast as I can and hop back into the bed. He comes in with a little glass bottle of Coke and a straw.
“Oh Stephen, you’re a darling,” I say, taking a sip. “I was parched. This is too much fun.”

“If you actually are interested in me, have you considered breaking it off with Hunter?”
“Honey, you know I can’t do that. I want to, but my family won’t be having any of it. They’ve been planning this merger for a long time.”
“But you said you wanted to be with me.”
“I do, you have to believe me. I do want to be with you. I’ll think about it, okay? I’ll think about what I can do,” I say, attempting to subdue my irritation. I start getting dressed.
“You’re going already?” He looks like he’s on the verge of tears.
“I have to go get my hair done for tonight. Can’t be looking terrible.”
He nods but doesn’t say anything.
“Oh, and Stephen, don’t mention a thing to Hunter, alright?”
* * *
I’m at the hairdresser Mother raves about to anyone who’ll listen. I was only expecting it to be Millie and me, but she’s forced her way in and deeming herself the queen of the Dead Girl Ball. She won’t allow us to have a more elaborate hairstyle than hers. The fruit doing her hair doesn’t stop chattering away, his high‑pitched voice echoing painfully in my skull. He has hair so blonde it could pass for white and jeans that look like they belong on a small female child. Mother’s getting an updo, a dramatic bouffant reminiscent of Brigitte Bardot. They share the same hair color, but Mother’s is natural. I get a center part and wispy, feathered waves. Millie’s hair is mostly down and straight, beneath a crown braid. I tell her she looks horrible for her own good. She sobs in the middle of the salon.
“Listen, Millie, I’m trying to help. Surely you want to have a boyfriend. Or you’re well on your way to becoming a spinster.”
“Millicent, you’re going to ruin your face for makeup,” adds Mother.
“I like it, and I’m going to keep it.” Millie wipes away a tear.

I roll my eyes and lean back in the chair as the assistant works the curling iron. “I don’t want any missed strands,” I tell her sharply, “I’m going to be photographed all evening.”
“Don’t you worry, darling, Jessy will make sure everything’s perfect,” he tells me, pointing to a small Asian woman who by no means looks like a “Jessy.”
“Wonderful, thank you so much.” I offer him a polite smile and return to the month‑old copy of Vogue I’ve been flipping through.
“Maris, have you prepared your speech?” Mother turns to look at me, causing the hairdresser to tut under his breath.
“No, Mommy, I plan to embarrass myself on stage in front of 500 of our nearest and dearest.”
She ignores the jibe. “Did you say ‘Mommy’? I don’t think I’ve heard that from you since you were seven.” She appears genuinely delighted.
“Maybe that was the last time you remember it.”
“Well, don’t throw a snit about it,” she retorts.
The absurdity of her childish response makes me laugh. For once it isn’t choked or forced. I almost feel bad for the string of bruises along her dainty collarbone. I wonder how much makeup it’ll take to cover them. “Oh, I do love you, Mother.”
The dresses we’re to choose from are all Halston and rather pretty. Had we more time, Mother would have personalized gowns made for us, but the dead girls and boys are piling up far too quickly. I’ve had enough of the color purple. Carol may have loved it, but it does nothing for me. I have a red gown, not bright enough to be gauche, with slits in all the right places and a deep v‑neckline, a small bow cinching in my waist. Millie is in royal blue, Mother in cobalt. I don’t tell her, but I hope to look like my mother when I hit her age. There’s hardly a wrinkle in sight. The worst marks on her are the ones given by Father, not nature. We aren’t allowed to touch the gowns until our makeup is on and settled, tested by the tip of Mother’s index finger. A speck of wet foundation will cause another minute of delay.

“Alright Maris, go get dressed,” she tells me once she’s run her cold finger down the center of my face.
“Glad to.”
I slip into the gown and a pair of Manolo Blahnik stilettos. They’re far from comfortable, but they look incredible. I was a bit late to jump onto the Manolo bandwagon, but his designs are gaining my loyalty. We’re chauffeured to the hotel where Father is waiting. I have no doubt that there’s a blonde tramp stumbling out of one of the staff entrances around the back. One glance at Mother tells me that she assumes the same. Her jaw is stiff as Father lends his hand to her, helping her step out of the car. Large standees and placards line the entryway announcing the gala. We’re to pose in front of them as a family, first. Father thinks it’s imperative the journalists to know that. I suppose hosting the benefit in and of itself is too subtle, how is everyone going to know the Caldwells donated? I hold back vomit and wait patiently for Hunter, almost blinded by the incessant flashes of cameras. I smile as I see him walking toward me, looking as pretty as any ornamental accessory could aspire to be. He uses the attention from the media as an excuse to pull me to him, planting a kiss on my cheek. I won’t deny that his natural scent, mingled delicately with a slight amount of Ralph Lauren Polo cologne gives me a headrush. I glance up at him—he’d look wonderful with a cyanotic hue. His hand travels instinctually to the small of my back as he leads me inside.
“You don’t still have that creep here, do you?” His voice is hushed but terse. He fidgets with his bow tie, one I imagine he had his mother put on for him. He’s always been inept with ties. “I saw him skulking around the neighborhood.”
“Hunter, are we getting a little jealous?”
“Dream on, I’m more embarrassed that my girlfriend is entertaining the idea and parading him around.”
“No, it’s jealousy.” I grin. “Don’t be a spaz.”
I hold him against me for support as cameras continue to flash, craving a poignant image of the philanthropists’ children mourning their friends. I try not to react when I see the cause

walking toward us. I’m aware that the Seattle Crime Prevention Advisory Committee had been invited to our shindig, but I wasn’t entirely sure Theodore himself would make an appearance. I give him no sign of recognition, and he responds in likeness, but there is piercing eye contact as he passes me. I have a copy of his rape prevention guide in my pocketbook. The irony is quite amusing, but who better to advise how not to become prey than a predator? Hunter is unmoved by Ted’s entry and why wouldn’t he be. As far as he’s aware, he’s just another good‑looking well‑wisher. I feel my stomach knot. “let’s get some champagne,” I say, grabbing onto his arm.
“Yeah, I’m too sober for this,” he agrees. He falls into step with me and flags down a greasy‑haired Latino waiter. “Two flutes, muchacho.”
Even I find his lack of a “please” semi‑offensive, but I’m glad to get some alcohol in my system. It both soothes and livens. “How are the others holding up?” I’m burning to remark on his snitching to Stephen. It’s infuriating. “Are they doing any better?”
“I haven’t talked to anyone much,” he says, as furtive as expected. “Jack is alright. He phoned a couple of times to shoot the breeze.”
“What about Stephen?” I press.
“You’re obsessed with Stephen, aren’t you? Are you sweet on him?”
“Oh yes, you caught me, Hunter, I’m sweet on the guy whose freckles connect into a blistering rash after twelve seconds in the sun. I can’t do any better than him,” I say sarcastically, gesticulating to mock him. I roll my eyes with such force that I can almost feel them shift to the back of my skull.
“Alright, settle down. Jeez, did I hit a nerve?”
“You should feel that way if you think I’d be sweet on him while dating you. That’d make you on par with him, a solid two out of ten. You sound like a fucking twelve‑year‑old girl talking like that.”
He laughs. “Carol would’ve loved that. She’d jump right in on the joke. She always did.”

“She was the only intelligent one, the rest of you are dimwits.” I let out a giggle to pretend I’m joking. They’re not the brightest bunch, that’s for sure. “I miss her. I miss her more every day.”
An image of her fresh corpse flashes in my mind, Ted hunching over it, startled when he realized he had company. It was July 16. The insects were yet to feast. The chief predator wasn’t satiated with only life leaving the flesh. He needed her for more. The crack in her skull and her blood‑streaked blonde hair were two mere appetizers. She was a vessel for pleasure and sadism, a garotte around her neck served to arouse him. For Ted, Carol’s death wasn’t her destination. Her body was ravaged sexually, pre and post‑mortem, but he wasn’t about to stop at round two. Unrestricted lust and rabid, beastly violence had taken over. He’d been startled when he heard my footsteps, as he should’ve been. The location wasn’t exactly easy to stumble upon. I’m not sure which of us was more shocked. I tucked my father’s trusty revolver into a holster on the belt of my jeans but panic still coursed through me. I could hear my blood thumping in my ears. Carol’s legs were splayed, her bikini bottoms ripped viciously into three jagged segments. Ted was zipping up his corduroy pants before his ears picked up on my presence, one of his hands pressing on Carol’s purpling chest to support his weight. Half of the seminal fluid was on her thigh, the rest on his.
He stared at me for almost a full minute, mouth partially agape. He was speechless. So was I. I didn’t look away. I didn’t know how to react. It was confronting, like a bullet to a gut that you only register once you fall. The other girl was a few yards away, congealed blood pooled around her abdomen. She was missing two forearms and a leg. Her eyes were open in the decapitated, semi‑crushed skull. Adrenaline kicked in, forcing me out of my numbness. I held my hands up in surrender. He quickly finished zipping himself up. The girls’ bodies were only a quarter of a mile from the body of one of my males.
“I haven’t seen anything,” I told him calmly. My voice was more strained than it should’ve been as if I’d escaped
