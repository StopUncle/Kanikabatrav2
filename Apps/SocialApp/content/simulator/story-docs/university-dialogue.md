# UNIVERSITY LEVEL: COMPLETE DIALOGUE

## MISSION 1: THE ARRIVAL

### Scene 1A: The Dorm Check-In

**Setting:** You're standing in the dorm lobby with your suitcases. The RA (Resident Advisor) is checking you in. They're friendly but professional, mid-20s, clearly used to managing new students.

**Inner Monologue:** "First impression. They control the dorm. Make them like you or make them irrelevant."

**RA:** "Hey, welcome! I'm Jordan, the RA for this floor. Let me get you checked in. First time away from home?"

---

#### Choice A: TRAP - Over-Eager
**Player:** "Yeah, I'm so excited! This is going to be amazing. I'm really nervous though. Do you think I'll fit in? I've never been away from home before."

**RA Jordan:** "That's great energy. Most people settle in pretty quick. Here's your key and the floor rules. If you need anything, my door is always open."

**Result Narration:** You came across as needy and uncertain. Jordan will be friendly but won't go out of their way for you. You're just another freshman. **Control -5 | Status: Low**

---

#### Choice B: SUBTLE - Professional
**Player:** "Thanks for the welcome. I'm looking forward to meeting everyone. What should I know about the floor?"

**RA Jordan:** "Good question. We have floor events on Thursdays, quiet hours after 10pm, and we all respect each other's space. You'll fit right in."

**Result Narration:** You were polite and asked the right questions. Jordan sees you as responsible. You're neutral in their mind—not memorable, but not problematic. **Control +2 | Status: Neutral**

---

#### Choice C: CLOSE - Charming
**Player:** "Thanks for the welcome. I can tell you actually care about this job. That's rare. What's the vibe on this floor?"

**RA Jordan:** "Ha, I appreciate that. Yeah, it's a pretty cool group. Lots of different people, but everyone's respectful. You'll like it here."

**Result Narration:** You complimented them genuinely. Jordan now sees you as someone who pays attention. They'll remember you and be slightly more helpful. **Control +5 | Status: Medium**

---

#### Choice D: OPTIMAL - Respectful Indifference
**Player:** "Thanks. I'll read the rules and reach out if I have questions. I'm sure I'll figure it out."

**RA Jordan:** (Pausing, slightly impressed) "I like that. Most people either panic or pretend they know everything. You seem grounded. If you need anything, I'm in room 101."

**Result Narration:** You demonstrated self-sufficiency and maturity. Jordan respects you. They'll actually help you if you ask, and they'll speak positively about you to other students. **Control +8 | Status: Medium-High**

---

### Scene 1B: The Roommate

**Setting:** You enter your dorm room. Your roommate (Alex) is already there, unpacking. They're friendly-looking, athletic build, seems confident.

**Inner Monologue:** "This person will be in your space every day. Establish the dynamic now."

**Alex:** "Hey! You must be my roommate. I'm Alex. I got here early to grab the better desk. Hope you don't mind."

---

#### Choice A: TRAP - Confrontational
**Player:** "Actually, I do mind. I got here first in terms of the room assignment. That's my desk."

**Alex:** "Oh, come on. I was just joking. But... okay, I'll move." (Moves desk but is now uncomfortable around you)

**Result Narration:** You won the battle but lost the war. Alex will be distant and awkward. Living with them will be uncomfortable. **Control -8 | Status: Low**

---

#### Choice B: SUBTLE - Accommodating
**Player:** "No problem at all. Thanks for unpacking. Which side do you prefer for the room setup?"

**Alex:** "Cool, cool. I'm pretty easy-going. Let's just make it work as we go."

**Result Narration:** You were accommodating, but you didn't establish any real dynamic. Alex will see you as easy to push around. **Control +1 | Status: Neutral**

---

#### Choice C: CLOSE - Friendly Competition
**Player:** "Ha, nice try. But I like your confidence. Tell you what—we can rotate who gets the better desk each semester. Fair?"

**Alex:** "I like that. You seem cool. Yeah, let's do that."

**Result Narration:** You acknowledged their move, showed you weren't intimidated, and proposed a fair solution. Alex respects you. **Control +7 | Status: Medium**

---

#### Choice D: OPTIMAL - Indifferent Acceptance
**Player:** "Looks good. I'm not picky about desks. Where should I put my stuff?"

**Alex:** (Slightly surprised) "Really? Most people would fight me on that. Cool. You can have the other desk, and we can figure out the rest as we go."

**Result Narration:** You demonstrated you're not petty or territorial. Alex sees you as mature and easy to live with. They'll like you and respect you. **Control +10 | Status: Medium-High**

---

### Scene 1C: The Hallway

**Setting:** You step into the hallway to explore. Three people are hanging out near the common area.

**Inner Monologue:** "Three targets. One is high-status, one is lonely, one is neutral. Who do you engage?"

**Narration:** You see three people:
1. **Sam** - Attractive, confident, clearly popular (high-status target)
2. **Jordan** - Quiet, sitting alone, seems shy (lonely target)
3. **Casey** - Friendly, neutral energy (neutral target)

---

#### Choice A: TRAP - Desperate Friendliness
**Player:** "Hey everyone! I'm new here. Can I hang out with you guys?"

---

#### Choice B: SUBTLE - Polite Introduction

---

**Player:** (To Jordan, who's sitting alone) "Hey, I'm new here. Mind if I sit for a second?"

**Jordan:** (Lighting up) "Oh! Yeah, sure. I'm Jordan. Welcome to the floor."

**Result Narration:** You identified the lonely person and engaged with them. Jordan is now grateful and will likely become an ally. Sam and Casey notice you're friendly but not desperate. **Control +6 | Status: Medium**

---

#### Choice D: OPTIMAL - Confident Observation
**Player:** (You walk past, make brief eye contact with all three, and stop to look at a bulletin board nearby)

**Sam:** (After a moment) "Hey, you new here?"

**Player:** "Yeah, just moved in."

**Sam:** "Cool. I'm Sam. Come hang if you want."

**Result Narration:** You didn't chase them. Your indifference made you interesting. Sam approached you, which means you're already establishing high value. **Control +12 | Status: Medium-High**

---

## MISSION 2: THE DORM

### Scene 2A: The Floor Party

**Setting:** Thursday night. There's an informal gathering on your floor in the common area. About 15 people, music, snacks, casual vibe.

**Inner Monologue:** "This is where reputations are made. Watch who has power. Watch who follows."

- **Jordan** is on the periphery (low-status)
- **Alex** (your roommate) is being friendly but not leading

---

**Player:** You approach Sam and try to join their conversation. You laugh too loudly at their jokes and agree with everything they say.

**Sam:** (After a few minutes) "Cool, well, I'm gonna grab some food. See you around."

---

#### Choice B: SUBTLE - Wallflower
**Player:** You grab some snacks and stand on the side, observing. You're friendly if someone talks to you, but you don't initiate.

**Casey:** (Approaches you) "Hey, you're new, right? I'm Casey. What's your name?"

**Result Narration:** You were safe but passive. Casey noticed you because you were quiet. You're now on their radar, but you didn't establish any real presence. **Control +3 | Status: Neutral**

---

#### Choice C: CLOSE - Strategic Socializing
**Player:** You approach Casey (the social connector) and engage in genuine conversation. You ask questions and listen.

**Casey:** (After talking for a while) "You know what? You're cool. Come to the party at Sam's place this weekend. I'll text you the details."

**Alex:** "Hey, I have this huge project due tomorrow and my laptop is acting up. Can I borrow yours for a few hours? I promise I'll take good care of it."

---

#### Choice A: TRAP - Angry Refusal
**Player:** "No. That's my laptop. Get your own fixed or use the library computers."

**Alex:** "Wow, okay. I guess I'll figure it out." (They're hurt and resentful)

**Result Narration:** You refused harshly. Alex now sees you as selfish and unwilling to help. They'll be distant and won't help you in the future. **Control -12 | Status: Low**

---

#### Choice B: SUBTLE - Reluctant Agreement
**Player:** "I guess so, but I need it back by morning. And be really careful with it."

**Alex:** "Thanks, I will." (They take the laptop but sense your reluctance)

**Result Narration:** You helped but without grace. Alex is grateful but also aware you weren't happy about it. Neutral dynamic. **Control +2 | Status: Neutral**

---

#### Choice C: CLOSE - Conditional Help
**Player:** "Sure, but let's set a time limit. You can use it until 11pm, and I need it back by then. Deal?"

**Alex:** "Perfect, thank you so much. You're a lifesaver."

**Inner Monologue:** "The RA is noticing you. Are you a problem or an asset?"

**RA Jordan:** "Hey, I've been hearing good things about you. Alex says you're cool, and Casey mentioned you're coming to the party this weekend. How are you settling in?"

---

#### Choice A: TRAP - Over-Sharing
**Player:** "Oh, it's been great! I'm so happy here. I was really worried about fitting in, but everyone's been so nice. I'm still getting used to being away from home though..."

**Target:** (Overwhelmed) "Wow, that's... a lot. I need to think about this."

#### Choice D: OPTIMAL - Predatory Acceptance (SECRET PATH)
**Player:** "That's great. But I want to be honest with you—I'm not looking for anything serious right now. I like you, but I also like my freedom. Can you handle that?"

**Target:** (Conflicted but intrigued) "I... I think so. Yeah, I can handle that."

**Result Narration:** You established yourself as the predator. The target is now yours, but they're also uncertain and seeking your validation. **Control +35 | Status: High**
