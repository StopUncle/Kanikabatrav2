Lauren shirt, rolled up at the elbows, tucked into a pair of tan, flared corduroys. His shaggy dark hair is combed back, and he’s young for a psychiatrist, probably only mid-thirties at the most. I follow him into his office, smoothing my cut‑offs down over my thighs. He closes the door behind us and takes his seat. I perch on the edge of the patient couch, and gingerly place my tan lambskin handbag on my lap.
“How’ve you been, Maris?” he asks.
“I’ve been well, Dr. Walsh, how’ve you been?” I ask, crossing my legs. “The new hair color looks fantastic, by the way.”
“Oh, thank you. I appreciate it. The dark hair has been quite a change.” He flicks through his file, looking up to smile at me. “I haven’t seen you in three weeks, what’s been happening?”
“I’ve been enjoying my holidays—exams were a nightmare.”
“How was Europe?”
“I spent a week in Madrid coked out of my fucking mind. I can’t say it wasn’t fun. I had some friends from school with me. We had a couple of weeks in Mom’s villa in Cannes beforehand to rest up. She wasn’t with us for a lot of the time, which was for the best.”
I study his tanned, somewhat leathery complexion. His eyes narrow slightly upon hearing my reference to cocaine. He swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing. He’s figuring out how to

broach the subject without seeming harsh, restrictive, or fatherly. It’s obvious he’s debating which issue he should discuss first, the apparent mother hate or the illicit drug use. Blinding orange light from the (very rare for Seattle) cloudless sky streams in through a gap in the drapes, dousing the brown room in a sickly glow.
“Is there a reason you’ve been using cocaine?”
The drugs first. Brilliant.
“I was on a holiday. I was with friends. I was done with exams. What can I say? It seemed like the right thing to do.” I feel the edges of my lips curling into a smile.
“Maris, I hope you understand the damage you can cause to your body with cocaine. I know you’ve experimented with lighter drugs before, but no illegal drug is safe, not even in small quantities.” His brow furrows from the seriousness of it all.
“To be fair, Dr. Walsh, pharmaceutical drugs aren’t exactly safe either. Snorting cocaine can have side effects, but no more than popping a Clonazepam or two. I’m halfway through a medical degree. I may not have all the knowledge you have, but I do know that much.” I meet his eyes and see color creeping into his cheeks. “But hey, it’s a lot more fun to be out in a club till 7 AM on cocaine than on Prozac or Mommy’s little helper, diazepam.”
“It appears to be self‑destructive behavior. Has everything been alright at home?”
“Things are great at home. Millie is back now too. She stayed in Madrid for a while longer since she didn’t have to get back to school.”
“How is Millie? Is she working now?”
“If by working you mean sunning herself at Lake Sammamish during the day and drinking herself into a stupor at night, then certainly. I don’t know what she’s planning on doing with her life, but I know it will involve promiscuity. Millie’s tastes are…eccentric.”
“What happened? I thought she’d enrolled in university?”
“She did, for a week.”
“She decided it wasn’t for her?”
H o ne y traT R A p

“Yeah, you could say that.” I quash a laugh, and instead run the tip of my tongue along the inside of my bottom lip. “Millie is not…uh, the university type. She thought it was far out until it came to handing in her first essay, then she split.”
“That’s disappointing. What do your parents think about this?”
“Well, as long as she’s not helping herself to the contents of their bank accounts or medicine cabinets, I don’t think they give a shit. Father doesn’t exactly approve of her lack of ambition, but he certainly doesn’t care enough to say anything to her.”
“They must be proud of you, though.”
“You would think so, wouldn’t you? After all, who wouldn’t want their child to become a doctor and save lives.” I grin. “I’m afraid you’d be wrong, though. My parents would prefer me to enter the hotelier business and help them out. Don’t get me wrong. They’re not upset by any means—they just want at least one child to be involved in the family trade. A chain‑smoking media princess is more appealing than a studious introvert.”
“You’re not an introvert, though, are you?”
“I wouldn’t describe myself as such, no, but exam season generally does cause social isolation. A socialite doesn’t often have to worry about a looming eighty‑percent weighted exam and can focus more on furthering brand images.”
“You’re probably right, there.” He chuckles lightly.
His attempts at sycophancy are transparent. It’s both amusing and irritating, and it takes me a few moments to respond. I know he thinks he’s edging on the precipice of my psyche, a single breath away from unraveling my thoughts. He leans forward on his chair, and focuses on his writing pad. He jots a few words down, his mouth lightly pursed. I can’t read what he’s writing, despite shifting closer to him.
“Okay, I know this isn’t what you’d most like to talk about right now, but how’re your eating patterns?”
“That’s a pretty complicated issue. I suppose if you mean to ask whether I’m still hunched over a sink every night throwing up a measly dinner, then no.”

“How many calories are you consuming per day?” He finally addresses the situation matter‑of‑factly, and it’s not as satisfying as I’d imagined it to be. I feel a nagging sense of annoyance, not particularly invasive, but I’d like him to believe it is. He’s always a bit uneasy asking about this sort of stuff. He struggles to broach the subject, so I’m surprised he’s managed this time around. He usually doesn’t have the stomach for it, pun intended.
“Fifteen hundred,” I say evenly. “My recommendation.” I suppose this is a half‑truth. I do consume 1500 calories, but not over one day, usually two.
“No, Maris, you’re five six. Your recommended caloric intake should be nearer to 2000.” He frowns and scribbles on the pad again, his gaze still firmly fixed on me.
“I tend to lose track of these things, especially on holidays. I was far more concerned with being able to find enough ecstasy to get me through a twelve‑hour stint at Club 66 in Ibiza.” I sigh for effect. “It was harder than imagined in the supposed party capital of the world.”
He partially chokes on a sip of water while attempting to maintain a façade of composure. “I’m disappointed. I’d thought we’d made more progress.”
“We’ve made plenty of progress. I have far better things to focus on now than how many bites I’ve taken of an apple. It’s alright, Dr. Walsh. It’s hard to get through histology on dream or E, so I won’t be continuing that.”
“I’m glad. I’m starting to worry, however. At our last appointment, things seemed to be flowing smoothly.”
“There’s nothing to worry about. I was trying to enjoy my vacation. It’s nothing alarming. I’m twenty‑three years old; there are worse things I could be doing.”
I’m growing tired of the dialogue. It’s normally a lot more entertaining to wind him up. He reacts quite easily to most things, especially when I mention them as nonchalantly as possible. Some psychiatrists are more difficult to read; their facial expressions do little in the way of revealing their neuroses and thoughts. Dr. Walsh, however, reminds me of a child: easy to decipher and
H o ne y traT R A p

equally easy to mold. I think he thinks I don’t realize when his eyes travel across the length of my legs or when his conservatism colors his interpretation of my drug‑related stories. He tries very hard to be that cool, far out dude, but his mannerisms scream of upper‑middle class, traditionalist grooming. He probably was sent away to boarding school, boys only, at around five, coming home to visit his parents and younger sister several times a year. His first sexual experience was most likely with a gawky, bespectacled girl lacking the confidence and finesse of a natural beauty. I almost feel sorry for him, his marriage seems unfulfilling. There’s a picture on his desk of his ten‑year‑old son and his wife—she’s not too rough on the eyes, a waifish brunette with clear, pale skin and large, chestnut‑colored eyes. Her argyle sweater and lackluster smile suggest repression, and I doubt her presence does much to prevent him from scouring hardcore porn magazines or fantasizing inappropriately about his less deranged patients. I suppose I shouldn’t get this much pleasure from messing with him, but I’m sure he could use the excitement in his mundane life. When I first met him, I kind of thought he was a fruit, but his style is unadventurous, and his wandering eye doesn’t violate the bodies of men.
“Well, that’s certainly not true,” he says, his tone disapproving. “I hope you understand how much harm you’re doing to yourself. If you continue this way you may end up hospitalized.”
If he’s good at anything, it’s doling out empty threats. He’s been talking about hospitalization for a year now. It wasn’t worrying back then, and it certainly isn’t now. Mother could never face the humiliation of putting her child in a sanatorium. Heavens, how the clients and newspapers would react.
“I know, that would be a true shame.” I cast my eyes downward in pseudo regret. “Things are changing now that I’ll have exams and assignments to get to in a couple of months.”
“You wouldn’t want to jeopardize your health or your future career, would you?”
I’m tempted to give him a scathing response, but my next appointment is well over a month away, and I’d rather not K anikaANI K A B AT R A

necessitate one sooner. I smile and nod. “You’re definitely right about that.” The insincerity must be palpable. I stop myself from reaching into my purse for a cigarette.
He sits back in his chair, crossing his legs. He places his chin in his palm. He wants to discuss my mother some more. Maybe he wants to discuss my father, maybe he wants to find out how deep my potential daddy issues may run.
“Are you still living with your parents, Maris?”
“I think you’re aware that I am. I’m too busy with university to find work at the moment.”
“But you don’t really need to find work, do you?” His voice is bitter.
“Are you suggesting I live off my parents for the rest of my life?”
“No, certainly not. I meant it’s not an absolute necessity when your parents are fairly high profile.”
“I’m not sure that’s the kind of thing I’d expect to hear from a psychiatrist, Dr. Walsh. It’s refreshing.”
He reaches for his cup of coffee, now half consumed. I feel like retching at the thought of drinking cold, stale coffee. The idea of coffee, in general, makes me ill; I only drink it out of necessity. He slowly sips, making another note on his pad; at this point, I want to rip it out of his hands.
“I’m glad you think so. How was your father’s trip to Shanghai? Is he back now?”
“I’m not actually sure. He possibly is. I haven’t seen him around, though. We run on different schedules.”
“You don’t talk to your father often?” He finds this interesting, although I’m not quite sure why. I know this has been brought up in conversation at least twice on different occasions.
“I probably see him once a week. He likes to arrange a brunch on Sundays if we’re all available. He mainly talks about which new hotels he’s opened up recently, and Millie and I pretend to care. Millie often has the aid of narcotics to get her through, which is more than I can say for myself. I’m unfortunately quite sober during our interactions.”

“You don’t enjoy his company?”
“Would you enjoy hearing someone boast about their business acumen for two hours at a time? It’s not as simple as me deciding whether I like being around him. He has his moments.”
“And your mother?”
“I’d certainly prefer Daddy to her—not by too much, though. I’m more likely to get Cartier from him when I agree to not tell Mother about the plum‑colored lipstick on his business shirts that does not belong to her. That color would do nothing for her skin tone.”
I watch as he digests this, his response less than adequate. I’d hoped to get more of a rise out of him; it seemed like a good thing to get him animated. I’m feeling a wave of irritation. I could use that cigarette about now. I haven’t smoked since Monday. I’m not a heavy smoker, mainly because my appearance is important to me, but I’ll usually smoke a couple of cigarettes a day just to take the edge off.
“Is your mother still involved in the operations of the business?”
“I don’t know. I don’t really care. I can ask her for you if you like.” I glance at my watch. Ten minutes to go. I didn’t expect the session to be this dull. I stifle a yawn.
“I was thinking we could arrange a group session: your mother, Millie, and you.”
“If you can convince them to take an hour out of a busy schedule of self‑medicating, that sounds like a plan.”
“I’m thoroughly enjoying your sparkling wit today, Maris.” He smiles at me, looking very disingenuous.
“I’m glad, Dr. Walsh. I try.”

CHAPTER TWO
Once I’m out of the stuffy office, I head to my car and pull out a Camel cigarette from my purse. I hold it gingerly between my lips as I light it, using the engraved lighter my grandmother gave to my mother on her last visit to our house. I’d found it in the den before I left and having misplaced my own, I tossed it into my bag. I take a long drag, drawing my breath deep into my chest and exhale a thick plume of gray-blue smoke. It’s unusually warm. Seattle doesn’t have very many days of heat or cloying humidity and rarely does the weather elicit the beads of sweat currently trickling down my spine.
I perch on the bonnet of the 1974 Porsche—a pale blue convertible number, brand new and gifted to me by Father out of guilt on my birthday a month ago. Millie received the same in mint green—and consider my options. My boyfriend is at Lake Sam with a couple of our mutual friends, and from what he told me on the phone this morning, they’ve managed to score a ton of Valium and dream. I live on the western side of the beach, so the positives include me being able to escape if they’re underwhelming company or have lied about the drugs, plus I’ve already got a bikini on underneath my tie‑front blouse. Millie might be at home, so I could hang out with her, but I know Mom wouldn’t be too far behind, and I can’t imagine anything worse than dealing with her for the rest of the afternoon. There’s not much of a debate. I climb into the driver’s seat, starting the car as I smoke the last of the cigarette.

The sun hangs low in the sky, beating down on me with merciless intensity. Almost blinded, I reach for my sunglasses and speed out of the parking lot. Traffic is sparse—surprising for this time of the afternoon and I hit the I‑90 within minutes. Karen Carpenter’s lilting voice sings from the car radio and the wind, cool and mildly salty, whips through my hair.
My happiness wanes when I reach the state park. The entire city seems to have congregated here, buzzing like insects with their loud children and ugly station wagons. I circle the lot multiple times before I find a cramped little space, almost a goddamn mile from the beach.
I strip to my bikini top, stuff my shirt in the dashboard, and light another cigarette as I walk to the usual spot. I see Hunter first, with Susannah, Carol, Dawn, Stephen, and Jack. They’re all laid out, melting into the worn picnic blanket.
“Hey, babe,” Hunter calls drowsily, pulling me to him. He’s already wired from the dope (and I’m guessing with at least two or three Valium pills too—Hunter’s mother’s stash is almost as vast as my own mother’s) and he’s smiling, flashing his perfect white teeth. He’s one of the most attractive boys in the area. He’s lean, and his face has prominent cheekbones, framed by a strong jawline. He’s a year younger than I am, and we’ve been dating since I was barely thirteen. Somehow, I’ve managed to survive the past decade with him. His conversational skills make me want to saw off his tongue and force it down his throat. I lean in and kiss him hello, offering him a puff of my cigarette.
“You’ve started without me?” I gesture toward the stash of pills in the center of the picnic blanket.
“It was hard to wait, but I tried,” he says. He gives me the once‑over, staring at my chest for a few very noticeable seconds.
“Well, I’ll have to catch up then. Dawn, honey, where’s the coke? Please tell me you have coke.” I grin at her, and she hugs me tightly from behind, her skin clammy against mine.
“I always deliver,” she tells me, folding a little plastic package into my hand.

““You look foxy today.” It’s Jack, He squints up at me, shielding his face from the sun with one arm.
“Jack, fuck off,” says Hunter, throwing his water bottle at him.
I start laughing. “Just today?” I kiss him on the cheek and obligatorily do the same with Stephen and the other girls. “Carol, is this your book?” I ask, grabbing a ratty copy of The Secret Woman.
She nods, “Yeah, and yes you can use it for the coke. I’d watch it, though. I’ve seen the cops about thirty times in the past hour. I think the pigs are having a picnic around here.”
“We should stop by and say hello when we’re high enough,” I say, arranging about a quarter of the cocaine into a neat line. I lean down and tuck my hair behind my ear, using a rolled‑up fiver to inhale as much as I can.
“Where were you? We’ve been waiting for you for hours,” says Stephen, who is the only sober one of the bunch. I’ve never seen him drink or take drugs in public, but I’ve also seen enough ketamine to kill several horses in his bedroom.
“I had to get some shopping done. What scintillating conversation have I missed out on?”
“Have you been watching the news lately?” asks Susannah, taking my half burned‑out cigarette from between my fingers.
“Well, not really, I only got back a week ago. I’m too busy missing the French Riviera. What’s going on?”
“Apparently these girls, around our age, maybe a little younger…I’m not sure. Well, they’ve been disappearing. One disappeared from our university. She lived in the district, on 12th Avenue.” She stutters, her speech mildly garbled, presumably from the beer bottle in her hand. “They think it’s probably the same guy. Honestly, I don’t think I can hitchhike anymore. I haven’t even been going out at all without Stephen.”
“It’s probably no big deal. Things like this happen everywhere. I don’t think we need to be changing our behavior because of one lunatic.” I shrug, taking a sip of her beer. My insides are buzzing from the coke, which travels rapidly and consumes each part of me until I feel almost breathless.

“He’s going after girls like us. I don’t know how, but it’s scaring me too,” chips in Dawn.
I let out a chortle. “What do you mean ‘girls like us’? I think you guys need to chill.”
“If anyone should be worried, it’s you. Slender, beautiful, long dark hair parted in the middle, petite.” She rattles off the characteristics one by one, counting on her fingertips.
“Five six is hardly petite, Dawn. I’m not worried, and you shouldn’t be either. Can we enjoy this for a while? Hearing about dead girls is killing my vibe. You know I’ll protect you if it comes down to it.” I flex my non-existent left bicep and she rolls her eyes in response. My body is tingling, and I’m too high to keep a straight face.
“I didn’t mention them being dead. Nobody knows yet, I hope they all come back. You’re tiny. What are you, ninety pounds? I don’t think you’d be a match for any man, let alone a psychotic criminal,” says Susannah.
“I’m ninety‑five pounds.” She’s killing my high and part of me wants to sock her in the mouth to make her stop talking.
“Well look, I’m not going to leave the house without at least one of you with me. I’m not taking any chances anymore. I’m too pretty and young to be dead, alright?” says Carol, propping herself up on her elbows.
“I don’t know if that’ll be safe. Did they specify what this guy looks like? It could be Hunter or Stephen or Jack. It could actually be any of them, and then you’re gonna go out with them, thinking you’re safe, but really, you’ll be screwed.” “It’s you, isn’t it, Jack?” I squeeze his arm.
“Of course it is, look at me, I’m deranged,” he says sardonically.
“It’s easy for you to laugh it off! You’re not going to be the missing girl,” says Dawn, smacking his chest.
“Calm down, neither are you.”
“That sounds like something the killer would say,” her light‑hearted tone taking on a paranoid edge. I imagine the reefer is finally frying her mediocre brain. She’s been smoking since we were in middle school and started stealing her mother’s lorazepam K anikaANI K A B AT R A

a couple of months later. Her memory is about as comprehensive as my grandmother’s was before she died of late‑stage Alzheimer’s. She begins nibbling on the edge of one of her long, unmanicured fingernails. I don’t know whether it’s the drugs or the sun that’s making my vision bleary, but from whatever sight I have left, I note the dirt caked inside and shudder. She flips her hair over her right arm, baring the abysmally designed dawning sun tattoo on her bony left shoulder. She’s not wearing a bikini underneath her ankle‑length dress. In fact, I don’t think I can see an outline of underwear either. Her parents are very much of the liberal persuasion—well, if I’m to be accurate, I’d say the pink persuasion. I’m surprised no one has reported them to the authorities for being commie sympathizers—they fall only slightly short of the Rosenbergs. Her sisters are named Rain and Chakra. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried.
“I’m kidding, these little princesses probably couldn’t even lift a woman. I don’t know how they’d abduct one,” I say, rolling down onto the blanket and closing my eyes. “No offense, Hunter.” I give him a condescending little tap on his thigh.
“Women’s lib has gone way too far already,” moans Stephen, lying down next to me. “Now they’re trying to have opinions.”
“Stephen, sweetheart, didn’t you find out your IQ was 95? I think you’re a little too slow to be a part of this discussion,” I tell him coolly. The other girls snicker at his expense. It’s not that they’re any smarter than he is if I’m honest. I think they all needed to be held back at least a year or two during high school, but Stephen is a smarmy little bastard that often needs to be put in his place. It’s easier to do this with other women around to laugh at him. I don’t quite care about gender politics; they don’t affect me in the slightest. But male chauvinists can be very entertaining. I like getting into (what Stephen considers to be) debates with him because his innate lack of intelligence is unparalleled. It’s like shooting caged animals at short-range.
“Don’t get into it with her, Steph, you know she’ll fry you,” says Hunter. He sits up and removes his shirt, flinging it at the wicker picnic basket.
H o ne y traT R A p

“I think women’s lib needs to go much further. I don’t think it’s safe to allow men like you to have opinions,” says Carol, rolling her eyes.
“See, this is why we need this guy out here keeping the girls in line,” says Stephen, tartly. His pale skin blooms with color. “Otherwise, you’ll all go crazy with power, like those damn fucking feminists on TV.”
“So, you think it’s alright that some sicko is going around handpicking girls to abduct because they might oppose one of your views?” she presses, leveling her gaze with his. Her contempt is far from hidden as she clenches her jaw.
“Dude, you really need to mellow,” says Jack, sliding his sunglasses on. “Leave the girls alone.”
“You’ll get your men’s lib soon, don’t worry,” I tell Stephen, running my fingers through his hair. I reach for the Valium and push the little blue pills toward him. “For now, focus on having fun.”
“Have some of my drink,” says Susannah, handing him a red plastic cup. I’m not quite sure what’s in it, but it sure looks more appetizing than the cheap beer I ingested. It must be out of her little flask. She carries it around with her to class sometimes. I suppose if I had her problematic skin, I’d be drinking at 9 AM too. She tilts his chin up with her index finger and kisses him for far longer than is appropriate in a social setting. I resist a gag and instead grab the flask from underneath her.
“I’m taking some too,” I say, and not seeing any spare cups around, I drink straight from it.
“I don’t know how you deal with him sometimes, Susannah,” Carol sighs. She pulls her glossy blonde hair into a chignon and pins it into place with a small butterfly clip.
Stephen takes a pill, uncharacteristically, and washes it down with Susannah’s sloshy liquor.
I can’t help but stare a little when Jack unbuttons half of his shirt. His chest is slim but defined, without a trace of hair. I suspect he waxes it off, but he’s never admitted as such. He’s one of Hunter’s closest friends and is remarkably similar in nature.
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

I could argue Hunter is the less bright of the two, but it’s a close competition. He’s a recent implant from California, and Stephen clearly stings from losing his childhood friend to a guy who doesn’t seem to own shoes. Susannah is the only girl who’s paid him any attention, so he’s clung on to her for dear life. Both their Utahan Mormon parents approve.
“Do any of you want to take a dip?” asks Dawn, stretching. She pauses and rubs tanning lotion onto her forearms.
“Yeah, I’m fucking dying out here. I don’t know how it’s this hot in Washington,” I say. I wriggle a little as I pull my Levi’s makeshift shorts off.
“Thank god you sorry losers never lived in Cali. This is like winter to me,” says Jack, particularly smug.
“Then, get in the water, pretty boy,” I say. “We’ll follow.”
“You’ve got it.” He tugs his shirt off and heads toward the lake.
“I’ll meet you guys there in two minutes. I’m going to stop by the ladies’ room,” I say, grabbing Hunter’s cigarette. He groans, but I’m up before he can say anything. I drop my sunglasses on his lap.
“We’ll be down there, Maris,” says Carol, stripping to her one‑piece. She points to a relatively child‑free area. “Here, Dawn, I brought a bikini for you. I know you tend to go commando.” She starts laughing.
“I just think underwear is unnatural, you know?” Dawn’s voice fades behind me.
I walk toward the bathrooms barefoot, wishing I’d had the foresight to bring something to tie up my hair. It falls an inch above my navel and is a nightmare to swim with. I readjust my bikini, for which the top is running obscenely tight. I’m pretty sure it’s Millie’s. She’s only a C‑cup.
“Hey, I’m so sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if I could get some help.”
I look up from my bikini strap to see a guy in tennis whites, with his arm in a sling. He’s about six feet and is unnervingly
H o ne y traT R A p

attractive. He grins at me. His eyes are a vibrant blue and his patrician nose culminates in a fine point. He has a light tan, and his chestnut hair is combed into neat, close‑cut waves.
I smile back at him. “You’re not bothering me. What kind of help do you need?”
He studies me with a deep concentration, hungry, barely blinking. It’s a look I understand very well. A look I know he’s straining to control. “I’m having trouble unloading my sailboat,” he says, glancing down at his bandaged arm. “I would really appreciate it if I could get your help.” His charisma is incisive, albeit shallow by the way he stumbles in between certain words as if second‑guessing himself.
“Absolutely, I’ll help you…but on one condition.” I hold his gaze steadily and put a hand on his uninjured arm.
He’s puzzled I’m sure he was expecting a little more resistance. “What’s that condition?”
“You have to give me a ride; I never learned how to sail.”
“Sure thing, you’ve got it. My car is down over this way,” he says, heading toward the overcrowded lot. “It’s so nice of you. I’ve been somewhat unsuccessful in getting a pretty girl to help.”
“I wouldn’t imagine it to be difficult for you, but I’m more than happy to help. What did you do to your arm?”
“Believe it or not, it’s a tennis injury! Sure hurts a hell of a lot, though.” He’s still watching me, his gaze traveling across the length of my body before squaring in on my face.
“Having played it since I was five, it’s definitely believable. The number of sprains I’ve had over the past eighteen years is astronomical. I didn’t get your name, by the way. I’m Maris.”
He extends his hand to me. “Oh, that’s rude of me. I’m Ted. It’s lovely to meet you, Maris.”
His accent seems slightly foreign, British, or Canadian, considering the way he rounds his vowels. There’s a lack of authenticity in it, though, and I’m not quite sure whether it’s merely a performance or not. He continues walking beside me, falling into step.

The asphalt is blisteringly hot, and I’m regretting not wearing my flip‑flops. The din of bustling young families and unattractive couples is distinct in the parking vicinity, so I move in closer to hear him. His refined manner is reminiscent of another time, steeped in politeness and chivalry. He leads me to a beat‑up, tan Volkswagen buggy, possibly the ’68 model. I look a little closer and notice the passenger seat is missing, and there’s no sign of a sailboat either.
“Wait, where’s the boat?” I ask, turning to face him. “This is the car, right?”
He’s still watching me, eyes bottomless and focused. He pauses for a moment, allowing himself to blink. His beautiful face betrays a certain anxiety, but he soon amends himself, standing up a little straighter, leaning on his car as he clumsily attempts to propose a justification.
“Oh, I’m so sorry. Didn’t I mention it’s at my parents’ place? It’s, ah, up the hill in Issaquah. It’ll only take a minute.”
“Whereabouts in Issaquah, are they? I ask. “So many of my friends live around there. I’m up in Bellevue.” While his persona lends him a certain air of reliability, I know he’s lying. He has a nervous twitch in his unaffected arm and his breath quickens briefly before he manages to get it under control, brushing it off with a cool, pleasant smile.
“Ah, it isn’t too far up, about a five‑minute ride. I promise it’ll be worthwhile. You’ll love sailing. I’m, uh, sorry I didn’t let you know beforehand.”
“Where would I ride? You don’t seem to have a passenger seat,” I ask playfully.
If I weren’t attentive, I’d almost miss the color appearing in his cheeks. It’s close to imperceptible, but I do have finely honed instincts. He’s been caught out. “Look, Ted, I’d love to help you, but I have to get back to my boyfriend and friends. They’ll worry that I’ve been abducted or something silly like that, you know? I would’ve enjoyed that sailing lesson. Perhaps if you’re here another day. Like I said, I live in Bellevue, so I’m here all the time.”

“Oh, right, okay. I’m sorry.”
“Sorry that I have a boyfriend? Or sorry you asked?”
“Sorry that you have a boyfriend, of course,” he says with a nervous laugh. He scratches the bandaged arm.
“Well, don’t go telling him, but I’m pretty flexible with the boyfriend issue. Come say hi if you’re here again.” I hold his gaze for several seconds. “I hope you feel better soon.” I wink at him and then walk backward a few steps, toward the bathrooms. He stands rooted to his position and then waves at me as I turn around. I almost want to hang around and watch as he finds another target, but I’m thirsty and hot as all hell. All I want is some alcohol and a long swim in the lake.
I jog a little, trying not to burn my feet, relieved when I finally hit grass. I drop into the bathroom, fix my bikini strap, and check my hair in the mirror. Women are lining up to wait for one of the two stalls to open. I’m not quite sure how people can bring themselves to use public bathrooms. I, for one, can do without contracting crabs from the unwashed masses. I don’t even share bathrooms with my family. Rosa, the daytime housekeeper, is on a short leash, and I make sure to watch while she cleans.
When I leave the bathroom, I notice Ted’s not around. I stop by the picnic blanket, where only Stephen remains. “Aren’t you coming?” I ask him, grabbing the bottle of SPF 40. I slather it onto my arms, stomach, and legs. I don’t particularly need ghastly red patches of sunburn.
“Nah, I want to read in peace for a little while,” he tells me.
I don’t give a shit, nor do I have the patience to pretend to. I take a long swig from the flask and run toward the water. Hunter, Jack, Susannah, and Dawn are frolicking in the shallow end, only knee‑deep. Dawn is splashing Hunter, still wearing her sunglasses. He sees me and pulls me to him by the waist, grinning. I lean into him, pretending to do so to kiss him, and instead shove him into the lake. He’s surprised, so the impact alone is enough to topple him. “Get in the deep end, you fucking losers,” I say, diving in.

The water is icy, despite the radiating heat from the sun. I stay under for as long as I can, only resurfacing when my lungs begin to ache. I float on my back, and Hunter swims to me.
“I’m going to get you back for that one.” His hands find their way to my hips, yanking me down deeper. He grazes my neck with his lips underwater. I grasp his shoulders and kiss him roughly, before kicking him away.
“Are you telling me you can’t wait the hour or so until we get back to my house?” I ask once he emerges.
“I don’t know. Have you seen yourself in that bikini?”
“You raise a good point,” I say, swimming out further. “But I think you can hold off.”
“Guys, don’t stop on account of me. I’m definitely happy to watch,” Jack calls, wiggling his eyebrows.
“Why don’t both of you make out, and I’ll be the spectator? I think that’s an idea we can all get behind, am I right, Susannah?” I grab her by the arm, using her as a temporary floaty.
“Hunter, I love you and all, but that’s something I can’t ever do,” says Jack.
“But you’re from San Francisco, Jack,” I push. “You must be used to that sort of thing.”
“I’m happy to watch,” says Susannah, mimicking his voice. Dawn giggles.
“I’ll see you at home, Jack baby,” says Hunter. His laughter is forced; I know when he’s uncomfortable. He has a rather strong hatred for the queers, which he strives to mask-he’s successful in doing so. He’s the heir to a candy company, and his public image has to be similar to mine: liberal, but not too liberal, supportive of the queers and blacks and Indians, but always erring on the side of the whites and straights. Quite frankly, I think he has neither the capacity nor the willingness necessary to cultivate that kind of image. The most he is capable of is speaking from improvised cue cards, being prodded by his cold, shrewd mother. While I recognize his absolute lack of ability to lead a company that large, I know that he’ll have a lot of weight behind him, should I ever need it. Also, I never tell him, but Carlyle chocolate annihilates

Godiva and Hershey’s combined. I make sure to swipe some whenever I’m over at his house. His parents are expecting our families to merge at some point soon, so they’re very generous with favors. They’ve planned a wonderful trip to Aspen for Hunter and me in the winter, allowing us the use of their entire chalet. I feel Vail is more enjoyable as it lacks the aspirational‑rich, who douse themselves in new money and ill‑fitting designer garb, which Aspen is absolutely rife with, but I’m grateful anyway to get the fuck away from my family.
“Where’s Stephen?” asks Jack, presumably to Susannah.
“He wanted to get some reading done. I don’t know, maybe he’s licking his wounds. He actually doesn’t know how to swim.” She pauses, placing a hand on her mouth. “Oops, I probably shouldn’t have said that.”
“He doesn’t even know how to swim? God, he’s really got nothing going for him. The least he could do is learn to swim,” says Jack, almost in hysterics.
“Not everyone’s as blessed as you, Jack. We can’t all have green eyes and picture‑perfect bodies,” I tell him, partially to get a rise out of Hunter.
“Don’t worry. I’m available for you any time, Maris.”
“I’m glad to hear that. I saw him on the picnic blanket, though. He was reading, so maybe he does want to read and isn’t ashamed of his inability to swim,” I say. “I’d probably be pretty ashamed about three‑year‑olds surpassing me, but we’re all different.”
“Was Carol with you, Maris?” asks Dawn, shielding her face from the sun with a bent hand. “She said she was going to the bathroom and would walk back with you.”
“No, I didn’t see her. She’s probably chilling with Stephen. Maybe she felt sorry for him and wanted to offer him company,” I say. I dip underwater again.
Dawn shrugs. “Yeah, you’re probably right, she’ll get here soon, I’m sure.”
“Stephen is definitely sparkling company,” Jack says, sarcastic and all, to Susannah’s derision.

“You just need to get to know him, he’s a wonderful person.” Her response is brief but terse, discouraging a continuation.
He mouths “ouch” at me when she can’t see, and I hug him, laughing into the crevice between his neck and shoulder. We swim for half a mile and then laze around in the water until I feel myself coming down from the coke. It’s a lousy feeling, and it makes me really sickly and anxious. It always helps to have Xanax or Valium around when coming down from a coke or ecstasy high. Ketamine is hell, nothing helps, and I rarely touch anything that requires a needle, so heroin and morphine are mostly out. The sun lowers into a peachy‑pink sunset over the lake, and the evening chill is somewhat aiding me as the weariness of the comedown takes hold.
“Do you guys want to head back in?” asks Hunter.
“Yes, thank you! I’m fucking freezing over here,” says Dawn, shivering for effect.
“Yeah, I could use a Vallie kicker right about now,” I say. I wade toward the shore, my limbs tender and worn out.
Stephen is splayed out across the picnic blanket in a rather effeminate manner, perched on two of the towels the girls brought. I yank one out from under him, giving him a polite little smile when he shoots me a look of irritation. I wrap it around myself, but I’m still trembling from the cold. I wipe off as fast as I can and pull my cut‑offs on; they do little to nothing to help. I huddle against Hunter, harvesting as much body heat as I can from him.
“You ready to head home, Stephie boy?” he asks. He looks like he’s struggling with a substantial amount of guilt for ditching his loser buddy for two hours.
“Yeah, I managed to get through all my book,” Stephen says breezily, but his face is tense and hardened.
“Where’s Carol? She said she would be joining us for a swim. I thought she might’ve decided to sit it out with you,” says Dawn. She glances down at Carol’s untouched suede Chanel purse. The keys to her Camaro poke out.

“She told me she was going to head to the bathroom. I thought she walked a different way to the water because she didn’t stop by.” Worry trickles into his facial features, slowly consuming them.
“Maybe she went home?” asks Susannah.
“Her purse and keys are still here. She wouldn’t leave without telling us, and she definitely does not live close enough to walk home and back to get her car,” says Dawn. She paces back and forth in panic.
“I’ll check the bathrooms, maybe she’s sick or has sunstroke or something,” says Stephen. He jumps to his feet and slips on his flip‑flops.
“She wouldn’t leave without her purse. I know Carol. She’d never go anywhere without her goddamn purse. She drove me in. I can’t drive a stick and my car’s still at the mechanic’s,” says Jack.
“Alright, let’s not freak yet. I’m sure she’s around here somewhere. We all know Carol. She wouldn’t leave her stuff and disappear,” I say calmly to curb the annoyance in the pit of my stomach. I want to go home, smoke several cigarettes, and knock myself out with some Valium.
“Maris, she said she was going to meet you. Did you not see her?” says Stephen. He’s jittery and confused.
“No, I didn’t see her. I would’ve at least passed her if she was near the bathrooms or on her way in.”
“Where the fuck is she?” asks Hunter, glancing around the park.
The crowd has dispersed considerably, with the families packing their picnics and children into various station wagons and SUVs. Apart from us, I can only see a handful of other groups, spread out thinly across the grass. I can’t imagine she’d have gotten far. She’s not exactly athletic, often winded after walking about half a mile. While intelligent, beautiful, and stylish, she has the fitness of a geriatric woman. I notice a few blondes, but none with the same shade of hair as hers. Hers is quite distinct. She is the only natural blonde I know, and the ones here clearly rely on Clairol for their color.

“Alright, Hunter, you check along the lake. Stephen, you stick to the bathrooms. Dawn, check the car park; maybe she’s near her car. Maris, you and I can scan the crowd, toward Issaquah and Redmond, a mile or two—you go north, and I’ll go south. Susannah, go to the phone booth and call her house phone, maybe she’s home. Meet back here in half an hour,” says Jack, assertive but flustered.
We scatter according to his directions, and I run along the grass, heading Redmond way. Running has always been one of my strong points, but I’m on empty right now. My body resists, and I’m starting to get cranky with the bitch. I don’t know if she’s out here, but I hope she’s not because I sure will rip her a new one if I see her, for making me go through this bullshit when I just want to be in my bed.
There’re barely ten or so small clusters of people left around this side of the park, mostly hippie high school types sharing doobies. It’s dusk when I’ve exhausted my search. I stand still, glancing in all directions. I call her name several times, in varying tones of irritation. No response. She’s got to be nearby. She definitely can’t walk back from Redmond. I don’t have time for this, and I’m starving. My stomach turns in on itself, the hunger wracking my body entirely. I give up and walk back to the blanket. Dawn is chewing her nasty, dirt‑filled nails, sobbing. Susannah is hugging her, wrapping a towel around both of them. Jack’s shirt is back on, and Stephen’s face is flushed.
Even Hunter looks on edge, pacing back and forth. “Nothing?” His tone is grim.
“I called her house, her mother said she hasn’t heard from her, then I called her dad’s office because it’s nearby and maybe she dropped in to see him or something, but no one’s seen her,” says Susannah, tears rushing down her face. She starts hiccupping.
“How on earth am I meant to drive her car back to her house without her in it? Her mother is freaking so badly. Her car’s brand new too. I don’t want to scrape it; she’ll be so angry,” says Jack, on the verge of tears. I’m tempted to slap them all at this point. If there weren’t so few of us, I’d have slipped out by now.

“Do we call the police?” Hunter’s the voice of reason, and I’m as surprised as the rest of them.
“Yeah, let’s let them handle it,” I say. Realizing I sound rather cavalier, I add, “I don’t think I can do this. I hope Carol’s alright.” I cry to cement my concern.
“Okay, ah, shit. Look, Stephen, can you drive the girls home in my car? Jack and I should go to Carol’s house in her car, so it would be good if you could meet us there. We can call the police when we get there,” says Hunter.
“It’s alright, I drove here,” I say. Maybe I’ll get to leave.
“Jack can go with you, then. I’ll drive Carol’s car alone. You’re her best friend. Maybe her mother will calm down with you there.”
“Yeah, I’ll take the girls home,” says Stephen.
“No, I want to go to Carol’s and be there if she turns up,” says Susannah, in between sobs.
“Fine, Stephen, drive the girls to Carol’s.”

CHAPTER THREE
It’s a shit show when we get to Carol’s. Her mother is a weeping mess, her bony chest heaving up and down with every sob. We’re all crowded into the cramped little sitting room because, apparently, she doesn’t see the need for the rest of us to have seats. She’s phoned the police and keeps looking up at a framed school portrait of Carol at her graduation. We wait, standing in a little huddle. She hogs the one sofa, and no one knows how to ask to sit. They’re all too polite and numb with shock.
“Not my Carol, not my Carol,” she repeats.
“Mrs. Greene, I’m sure she’s alright. You know Carol. She’s always getting herself into little adventures. It’s only been a few hours,” I say tiredly, for the seventh time.
“Maris, she wasn’t with you? You’re her closest friend. Why wouldn’t she tell you where she was going? Was she talking to other boys?” She barrages me, also for the seventh time, and I brace myself to answer her without snapping.
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Greene, I didn’t see her. You know I would tell you. Carol gets into adventures all the time. We should wait for the police.” I shiver violently, and my teeth start chattering. “Mrs. Greene, please stop crying.”
“She’s my only daughter, she’s my only daughter.” She rocks back and forth, looking like an absolute basket case. “I bought her the Camaro, so she’d be safe. Nothing can happen to my Carol. I begged god for a girl for so many years.”
25
“Mrs. Greene, you know Carol’s very careful. I don’t think you should panic yet,” I say.
I look out to the driveway where the Camaro sits, glossy and empty. She follows my gaze and cries harder. Susannah and Dawn are crying, too, their wailing contributing to an excruciating crescendo. I stand silently, my still‑wet hair dripping icy water along my neck and chest. Mrs. Greene stands up and squeezes me, crying into the hollow of my shoulder. I close my eyes and pat her on the shoulder, gently, awkwardly, while I think of an excuse to go home. I offer surface-level concern and mimic her behavior, shedding as many tears as I can until the doorbell finally rings. The cops are plain‑clothed and gruff, unaffected by Mrs. Greene’s frenzy.
The shorter one speaks first. His hair is slicked back, and I’m not sure if it’s gel or sweat that’s holding it in place. “Uh, so when did you last see Carol? Has she run away from home before?” His beady eyes dart around the room while he jots down notes. He stares at me for a few seconds before turning back to Mrs. Greene.
“No, no, she hasn’t run away. She’s missing. My Carol never does things like this. She’s a very happy girl. Why aren’t you there looking for her?”
“Why aren’t we where?” This time the taller one speaks. His face is rounded, quite like a manatee.
“Lake Sammamish, where she went missing. Why aren’t you looking there?” She sits down again, sobbing hysterically.
“I take it you kids were there with Miss Greene?” He looks at us.
“Yes, sir, we went to Lake Sam for a picnic and a swim. It was so hot. Carol said she was going to use the bathroom and then meet us at the water’s edge, but she never came. We thought she was maybe sitting with Stephen, who was reading on our picnic blanket, but she wasn’t around when we came back about an hour and a half later,” says Hunter, composing himself. He’s still high and very fidgety. He has a real problem around police as if he’s about to be arrested for something when usually all he’s done is smoke reefer.

“Carol’s a very responsible person, and she’d tell us if there was an issue. It’s possible she bumped into other friends, nearly everyone we know is at the lake when it’s hot out,” I say, addressing the short one. He lets me know his name is John.
“I think you all ought to head on home and get some rest so we can talk to Mrs. Greene. We’ll call tomorrow to organize meetings with each of you to get your accounts of what happened and everything you remember. Obviously, you’re all, uh, kind of affected, and we need you to be alert so we can get the search started. She’ll likely return within the next twenty‑four hours as most runaways do—” he is curbed abruptly by Mrs. Greene.
“She’s not a runaway. She’s missing. My daughter is missing.”
“Alright, well, we’re going to do our best to find her, ma’am. Go on home, kids.”
Forlorn and defeated, they fall one by one and acquiesce. Susannah is the first. She dries her tears with the back of her hand, shoulders slumped. Stephen holds her protectively as if she’s at risk of facing the same prospects as Carol. His earlier audacity has morphed into cowardice and fear. Hunter holds my hand tight and Jack stays put, immobile.
“Please let us know if you find out anything. I’ll likely be awake most of the night. I’m meant to work with my father tomorrow, but if you need me, call me and I’ll be there,” I say, forcing a tear to slip along my cheek.
“Pardon me if I’m wrong, but you’re Maris Caldwell, right? I’ve seen you in a couple of my wife’s magazines. You’re Henry Caldwell’s daughter?” John eyes me, examining my face to reassure himself. I’m surprised he’s managed to snare himself a woman at all, what with the pig snout he’s passing off as a nose.
“Yes, I’m one of his daughters. Just give me a call if need be. I hope Carol’s home soon.” I turn to her mother, “Please don’t fret, Mrs. Greene, Carol will be terribly upset once she finds out how distraught you’ve become.” I wave, thankful, and ready to bolt. I drag Hunter along, with Stephen and the rest trailing behind us.
“Come on, Jack. I’ll drop you home,” I say when we get to the driveway. “You’re right on the way.” He lives about two blocks

away, and Hunter is an easy twelve‑minute walk from my house. That was convenient before I’d learned to drive and was too inept to take my mother’s keys when she was out cold from the Klonopin. I always thought she’d wake up in time to see me hightailing her car out of the garage.
“I’ll get Susannah and Dawn home,” says Stephen.
“Call us when you’re all home safe, alright?” I shout, with as much concern as I can muster. It’s the best I can do when I’m coming down, and they should be glad I didn’t drive home straight from the lake. Hunter and Jack settle into the car, and I strap my seatbelt on. “Are you doing okay, Jack?” I glance at him in the rear‑view mirror. I reach into the dashboard for my blouse and ChapStick. My lips are dry as all hell.
“I’m okay. I’m just…I don’t know. I don’t know where she would’ve gone without telling me. She’s not like that. She’s always so cautious.”
“I’m sure she’s fine. Don’t panic too soon. You know worrying does very little in the way of helping,” I tell him, rephrasing the line I’ve been using on her mother all evening.
We drive most of the way in silence, and I have a niggling suspicion that Jack’s crying in the back, but I go out of my way to avoid looking at him. Seeing a man cry is so nauseating. It’s in the top five of the ugliest things I’ve ever seen, second only to excrement. When I reach his house, I pause on the side of the street and wait impatiently for him to peel himself off the leather seat. Jack’s walk to the front door is excruciating, and slow to watch. He half‑waves and disappears inside.
“You’re coming back to my house, aren’t you, babe?” I ask, turning to Hunter. I grin. I don’t want to drive him home, and I could probably do with a little action while I wait for the benzodiazepines to kick in.
“Yeah, we haven’t had much alone time.”
“Millicent and my mother will probably be home, but we’ll get past them pretty quickly. Just make sure not to mention this whole debacle. I don’t want to deal with a fucking press conference, especially since Carol will probably waltz in tomorrow all casual.”

“I won’t say anything, don’t worry. It was hard enough dealing with Carol’s mom.”
I pull into the excessively long winding driveway. I could swear it’s almost a mile to the front door. Renata, the portly night maid, answers the door, taking my purse for me. Hunter offers her a polite, robotic smile and hello. I lead him through the house, down the hallway and vast parlor, to the casual sitting room toward the back where I’ll need to give my dutiful greetings to my mother—if she’s not drowning in a river of wine and Xanax upstairs.
We encounter Millie first, as I’d expected. She was due to hang out with us earlier, but she’s always been quite the flake. I’m older by twenty‑three minutes, and almost nobody can tell us apart. We’ve managed to trip up our parents on many occasions. Looking at her is like looking into a mirror. She’s an inch taller, but, other than that and our bra size, there’s almost no visible dissimilarity. She has silken jet‑black hair. It falls in a sheath to the small of her back. She boasts full, bee‑stung lips, a small, delicate nose, and doe‑like aquamarine eyes. She’s very slender but has no interest in running or athletics in general, so I’m about five pounds lighter. We both share Mother’s Mediterranean tan and high, well‑defined cheekbones, and Father’s long, naturally black eyelashes. Mother is tiny, barely topping five feet, but she generally has the attention of every male aged twelve to seventy‑five in the vicinity. Millie and I take our height from Father, who’s closer to about six two. Millie’s sitting Indian style on the leather sofa, watching The Mary Tyler Moore Show with wide-eyed joy. It’s been her favorite show since it came out four years ago after I initially found it and developed a liking for it, and usually, we watch it together. I love that Mary; she’s adorable. Millie is in my silk charmeuse La Perla slip and robe, but I don’t have the energy to be annoyed.
H o ne y traT R A p
29
“You’re watching Mary without me, Millie?” I ask, draping myself around her. I kiss her repeatedly on the cheek. She squeezes me back, grinning.
“I had no idea when you’d be home. It’s a new episode, Maris. We were meant to watch it together, but I see you were out with Hunter here.” She pulls him down into a hug.
There’ve been at least six or so occasions we’ve managed to confuse Hunter into not knowing which of us he’s dealing with. It’s always good fun, especially if I need an excuse to yell at him about something.
“How are you, Millie?” he asks.
Mother walks in, still in her daily uniform—an elegant but bland Dior square neck dress that ends just above above her knees. Her pearls are around her neck, and the Harry Winston diamonds are embellishing her ears. She is rarely without her heels, even at home. She’s perpetually on a diet and won’t go a day without this bizarre red Rooibos tea that kind of tastes like dirt.
“Hunter, it’s lovely to see you again. Maris, I feel like I haven’t seen you all week.”
It’s most likely because I’ve been avoiding her for almost the entirety of the past week, leaving before she wakes around noon and coming home when she’s in a stupor.
“You, too, Mother—it’s great to see you.” I peck her quickly. “I’m exhausted and cold, though, so is it alright if I head upstairs to shower?”
I don’t wait for an answer. I drag Hunter out of there as fast as I can. I ascend the stairs two at a time despite the dull sting in my thighs. I lead him to my room, but he doesn’t need directions. He closes the door behind us and sits on my bed, playing with the twirling silk from the canopy.
“I need a shower, do you?” I ask. I hold his gaze and unbutton my blouse. I undo the strings of the bikini top and let it fall to the floor, along with the cut‑offs.
He reaches for my arm and pulls me to him. Sitting down, his eyes are level with my chest, but he looks up to my face, studying
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

me closely. He kisses along my neck before brushing my lips with his.
“You’re so beautiful, Maris.” His hands press into my waist, and he pushes me onto the plush quilt cover. His kisses become harder, more fervent as he climbs on top, holding himself up with one arm. I can hear footsteps outside my bedroom door. He freezes.
“Are you scared someone’s going to walk in on us?” I taunt him, challenging him to push on. “Oh no, what a nightmare that’d be!”
He grabs at my bikini briefs, almost tearing the soft fabric in the process of pulling them off.
* * *
I wake around 10 AM. Harsh sunlight streams in through the bay windows. My bedside telephone is ringing incessantly. The Valium and Xanax combination I used last night to knock myself out hasn’t worn off yet, consuming my body with an overwhelming sense of lethargy. I fumble for the receiver, squeezing my eyes shut as I border on blindness. I don’t know why I keep forgetting to close the goddamn drapes. I hope it’s not Father waiting to badger me about not turning up to his new downtown hotel. I’m supposed to be on the advertising team now that I’m on college break.
“Hello?” I’m cranky and my voice rasps from the alcohol and the cocaine nasal drip. I almost regret taking as much coke as I did, but I remember that I didn’t pay for any of it and I’m quite pleased.
“Hello, is that Maris Caldwell?”
“Uh, yes, this is Maris speaking.”
“Hi Maris, it’s detective John Simpson, we met last night at Miss Carol Greene’s house.” His voice is gentler on the phone, with a kindness that seemed entirely absent in person.
“How may I help you, detective?”

“I understand that Mr. Carlyle may be with you, we’ve attempted to reach him at home with no luck. We’d be very grateful if both of you would come down to the station to discuss Carol’s whereabouts yesterday.”
“Wait, she hasn’t come home yet?”
“No, unfortunately she has not returned, and we’re attempting to piece together her movements so we can find out what could’ve happened.”
I shake Hunter forcefully into consciousness. His first instinct is to raise his hand to his face to shield his eyes from the sun. He blinks sleepily, confused. I sit up a little straighter, clearing my throat. “Yes, of course. He’s with me. What time would you like us to come by?”
“As soon as you can, Miss Caldwell, your other friends are giving us statements currently. We have been trying to contact you since about eight this morning, but I’m not sure if your housekeeper understood us.”
“Alright, sure, I’ll try and be there within the hour.”
“Thank you, we appreciate your time and effort.”
I place the phone down, sitting dumbfounded. “Carol still hasn’t come home, Hunter.”
He jerks upright as if prodded by a branding iron. “What the hell, are you kidding me?”
“Clearly not, they want us to come to the station as soon as possible. We need to get dressed.” I spring to my feet, heading directly to the bathroom to brush and shower. I’m starving, and I definitely need that time to eat breakfast. I get dressed in a Kelly‑green tennis miniskirt, knee‑length socks in a matching shade, and a short‑sleeved Indian print blouse. I debate between my platforms or patent leather Mary Jane heels and decide on the latter. I’m not usually one for makeup, but I use my Chapstick, eyeliner, and a hint of the baby blue eyeshadow my mother brought me from her last trip to Paris. I brush my hair into place, parting it in the center and combing it over my shoulders and chest. I grab a pocketbook from my closet. “Hunter, you shower, I’ll be downstairs in the dining room.”

“Maris, how could you forget to tell us that your friend went missing last night?” This is my mother’s way of greeting me once I’m in the kitchen.
“How did you find out?” I grab a fresh croissant from the bakery basket. Rosa may be difficult to look at, but her food is the closest a person can get to heaven.
“What do you mean, how did I find out? It’s in the newspaper, for god’s sake. Maris, what is wrong with you?” Her honey‑colored eyes darken in ire. “Poor Carol’s disappeared and all you had to say was that you were cold and wanted to shower?”
“It’s in the newspaper? Wow, a little bit of an overreaction if you ask me.”
“Here, see for yourself.” She slides a newspaper at me across the granite benchtop. Two girls have vanished from Lake Sammamish, according to the front page. There’s a police sketch of a handsome twentysomething man named “Ted” accompanying the shock‑factor headline. They’ve not captured Ted well by any means. His nose had a better structure and his eyes were larger, very feminine. The sketch makes him out to be a bit of a grungy savage, I can only imagine how annoyed he must be. His whole act attempted to establish the exact opposite.
“There was a second one too? Jesus!” I bite into the croissant. “Damn, Rosa skimped on the butter today, didn’t she?”
“I’m not quite sure what to say to you right now,” she says, her jaw clenched.
“Well, I have to drop by the police station in about ten minutes, so there’s barely any time. You’re safe.”
“Did you see him? Did you see her going with him?”
“No, I didn’t see him. I don’t know who he is. The last I saw of Carol was at the picnic blanket. Don’t be so dramatic.”
“Have you even mentioned it to Millie?”
“Mentioned what to me?” asks Millie, strolling in, dressed in a cotton summer nightgown.
“Millicent, why aren’t you dressed yet? It’s 10:30 AM,” my mother snaps. I’m surprised she’s awake herself at this time.
“I don’t have anywhere to be just yet.”

“Go on, Maris, tell her what’s happened.”
“Well, Mill, Carol disappeared from Lake Sam yesterday. Why don’t you read this newspaper, though? It seems to revel in sensationalism and Mother is clearly a fan,” I say calmly as I flip over to the second page. “She’ll turn up in a day or two.”
“Maris is right, Mother. I don’t think there’s anything to be worried about,” she says steadfastly. She looks at me. “I don’t need to read that crap, I trust you.”
“Do you ever say anything contradictory to your sister, Millicent?” Mother is fuming now.
“Why would she need to? She’s smart enough to know what to believe. It takes a real moron to fall for salacious stories in newspapers clearly created to profit off gullible readers.” I smear a little strawberry jam onto the remaining portion of the croissant, licking the spillage from my pinkie finger. I devour it in two bites and then pour myself a cup of black coffee; I need to stay awake. I could really use a cigarette but, as far as my mother is aware, I don’t smoke. While I enjoy irritating her, I don’t want to risk being cut out of the will. “Mother dear, you do make the best coffee.”
She doesn’t know how to use the coffee machine. I don’t think she’s tried either. Her rage is palpable. She smears on an alarming fake smile when Hunter traipses in.
“Come on, Hunter, we’d better get going.” I brush the crumbs from my blouse and grab his hand.
“Bye Mrs. Caldwell, Millie.”
I grab my keys from the hallway. “You can get something to eat after,” I tell him. Once we’re out of earshot, I ask for cigarettes. He always keeps a pack in his jeans, and I could’ve sworn he tossed it into the dashboard last night. I was high as a kite, so I don’t remember exactly, but the vague outline of the trip is in my mind.
They separate us once we’re there. Hunter is led into a room on the other end of the hall, and Susannah and Stephen are seated in the waiting area in the center of the office. I’m a little surprised that no one here recalls me. My records were expunged, but I imagined at least someone would remember me. It’s all a little
K anikaANI K A B AT R A

too familiar: the vomit‑yellow paint on the walls is peeling, and the linoleum flooring is sticky against my shoes. King County PD doesn’t seem to have been updated at all.
“Maris, thank you for coming on such short notice—would you like to accompany me to a questioning room? It’s up this way,” says John. I feign ignorance and follow compliantly. He doesn’t know that I’ve memorized the floor plan for convenience.
He and I are alone. He has a cup of coffee at his side. He hesitates for a second and then decides to ask if I’d like a drink, and I decline.
“What would you like to know, detective Simpson?” I clasp my hands together on the desk. I assume it’s his. It’s a bit of a sty, though, so it could be a communal desk.
“Can you please run down your activity yesterday, from about 2 PM to 7 PM?” He adjusts his grandfather‑style rectangular glasses.
“Yes, I certainly can. I arrived at Lake Sam about two, perhaps a little earlier, and looked for parking for half an hour or so. It was a real mess, there were cars and kids everywhere—everybody and their extended families seemed to be congregating. When I managed to get parking, I walked down to where we usually hang out in, near the water and all. They were there, Susannah, Stephen, Dawn, Carol, Jack, and Hunter, I mean. They were on Hunter’s ratty old picnic blanket, eating sandwiches that Carol had made. We talked for a while and decided to go swimming, but I had to use the restroom. When I came back, I went straight for the water and stopped by the picnic blanket to see if anyone was still there—only Stephen was. He’d made a couple of questionable comments, it’s very silly, and I won’t go into it, it’ll only bore you, and I told him I’d be with the rest. We were swimming for an hour or two, and when we went to dry off, Stephen was still the only one there. Carol was quite upset by what he’d said, but I figured she’d have calmed down by then. We searched for her for well over an hour. I headed toward the Redmond end, and Jack looked around the Issaquah end. We ended up going to Carol’s house to let her mom know and then she called you guys.”
H o ne y traT R A p
35
He doesn’t interrupt me, listening quietly, patiently, and writing down notes. When I’m finished, he speaks. “I understand it might have been silly, but what exactly did Stephen say to upset Carol?”
“Oh, I don’t want to get him into any trouble or anything. It wasn’t much of a big deal. They were talking about some girls our age going missing around Seattle, and he said that it was probably for the best—I’m paraphrasing here—because the women’s liberation movement was giving women too much power to speak, and someone had to keep them in line. He said that it was good that this man, well, we’re assuming he’s a man, was essentially putting women in our place. I don’t think he was being serious, he’s often quite flippant.”
“He actually said those things?” He’s concerned, brow furrowed, disbelieving. “What a bizarre thing to say.” He speaks as if he were alone and talking to himself.
“Stephen is a little peculiar—I don’t think he intended to offend anyone. Like I said, it’s all very silly.”
“Were Stephen and Carol alone at all?”
“I think so. When I went back out to the water from the bathroom, the rest told me that Carol was with Stephen and had to use the bathroom, so she’d be back soon. I think they must’ve been alone for a little while at least. I wouldn’t expect too long. Carol isn’t exactly Stephen’s biggest fan.”
“I see, did they often argue?”
“I guess they were a little quarrelsome, but I don’t think there was any bad intent on either of their parts.”
He pulls a sheet of paper out of a manila folder. It’s the composite sketch of Ted.
“Did you see this man at all while you were at Lake Sam? We’ve had reports of him speaking to several women outside of the restrooms. His arm was apparently in a bandaged cast.”
I study it for his benefit, concentrating really hard. “No, I can’t say I saw him. I would’ve remembered that.” Ted needs to remain in the shadows, at least for now.

“Another young woman vanished several hours prior to Carol, in nearly the exact same spot. Are you quite certain you don’t remember this man? He approached quite a few young women, much like you.”
“No, I absolutely would recall if a man in a cast approached me, detective, with all due respect. I don’t think it’s something you’d forget, at least not in a 24‑hour period.”
“Oh, yes, of course. I’m sorry. I didn’t intend to imply that.” He places his fingertips on the surface of the desk as he thinks—I imagine he’s figuring out how to word an accusation against Stephen.
“Do you think Stephen could have anything to do with this? We do have reports of this Ted person, but we’re not sure that he’s responsible or that his name is, in actuality, Ted.”
I hesitate. “Well, uh, I’m not quite sure.” I shake my head. “No, no, I don’t think Stephen would do anything like that. He’s a great guy, a little strange sometimes. I’m sure, I’m sure he wouldn’t do that.”
“You seem a little undecided. We’re not trying to assume here. I want to know a little more about Stephen and his actions on the day. There’s no blame as such, I want to make sense of the situation.”
“Okay, now I don’t want this to be taken the wrong way, but Stephen sometimes enjoys scaring women, like sometimes he’ll hide behind our cars and jump out when we try to unlock our doors. It’s always a joke. Like I said, he’s a bit eccentric. Maybe he tried to scare Carol…Other than that, I honestly wouldn’t say he caused her any harm.”
“Has he ever tried to, uh, ‘scare’ you?” He uses air quotes.
“Yeah, he’s tried to a couple of times—once he knocked me into the Yakima River when we were white water rafting.” John doesn’t need to know it was the other way around. If I’d been the one pushed in, I wouldn’t cry like a little bitch like Stephen did.
“Didn’t you find that a little strange?”
H o ne y traT R A p
37
“I guess I did, but it was just one of his little jokes. Please don’t say I mentioned it, I don’t want to upset him. I thought it’d be alright to mention it. It was a joke.”
“Don’t worry, Maris, this is confidential.”
I meet his eyes, simulating reluctance, nervously interlocking my fingers. “I don’t want him to get into any trouble. I don’t think he’s responsible for what’s happened to Carol, assuming she has actually gone missing and isn’t with other friends.”
“It’s not looking good at the moment. We’ve released images of both the girls to media outlets, and we should’ve heard back if they simply were otherwise preoccupied.”
“Oh lord, no.” I start sobbing quietly. He hands me the Kleenex box but doesn’t comfort me. “I can’t lose hope—I have faith she’ll return. I’ll begin praying for her.”
“I’m afraid there’s only so much prayer can do,” he tells me, unmoved. He probably has mothers in here crying daily. “Do you remember Carol saying anything out of character?”
“No, not really, she was her usual self. She was in high spirits. She’s always a very cheery girl.”
He makes more notes and then pushes another photo to me, this time of a Bambi‑eyed blonde. “This is Janine Warren. She was last seen approximately six hours prior to Carol going missing. Did you by any chance come across her?”
“I wouldn’t have reached the lake by then.”
“You see, we have quite a problem here. Girls have been going missing since January, and now two have disappeared on the same day, in broad daylight. Are you absolutely positive you didn’t see or speak to a man who called himself Ted?”
I’m a little confused. I’m not sure what he’s getting at, oscillating so quickly between Ted and Stephen. “No, I did not see a man who looked like Ted, I did not speak to one named Ted either.”
“Alright, so we may have to look a little deeper into your friend Stephen. What can you tell me about him?” He’s frustrated, shallow crow’s feet forming at the corners of his eyes.

“I don’t know, there’s not much to tell other than what I’ve already mentioned. We grew up together. He’s pretty shy and can be quite awkward. He’s never had much luck with women, but he’s dating a mutual friend now, Susannah. He’s pre‑law at UW.”
“Is there anything else you can remember about yesterday that might be out of the ordinary? I’m sorry to be so pushy, but I’m sure you can understand the gravity of the situation.”
“No, detective, nothing. I’ll be certain to let you know if I recall anything else—please call me with any updates on the case. I’m so worried about my Carol.” I let out another little sniffle.
“Well, if that’s all the information you can provide, I think we can wrap things up.” His affect is cold, clinical. He gives me a mechanical pat on the shoulder and again offers the box of tissues to me, which I refuse. He ushers me into the hallway where Hunter is sitting dejectedly. His face is drained of color, as is Stephen’s. Susannah’s gaze is directed to nowhere in particular, and absent. It’s looking like a goddamn funeral parlor in here.
“Are you guys done?” I ask, wiping away a non‑existent tear from the corner of my eye. “Thanks, detective,” I add, turning to John. He smiles and closes the door.
“Did you see that other girl? She was so beautiful,” says Stephen. “I can’t believe two disappeared on the same day.”
“You do have a thing for blondes, don’t you?” I say it softly but ensure the taller detective is in earshot. “It’s so horrifying that girls are missing, let alone girls we actually know.”
“Carol does have friends up in Issaquah and some others near Snoqualmie Pass, maybe she’s visiting,” says Hunter.
“Don’t you think it’s a little far‑fetched that she’d head up to the Cascades without her car? Even if she did decide to hitchhike, don’t you think she’d have left her car at home first?” Stephen doesn’t disguise his skepticism.
“Poor Jack must be devastated. I’ve never seen him so smitten with a girl before,” I say, to make conversation. I just want to go back to bed.
Susannah’s hand is clammy and trembling when I reach to hold it, jolting her back into reality. Her shoulders are flush
H o ne y traT R A p
39
against the hard, wooden bench and her legs are crossed, the top one trembling.
“Susannah, honey, are you doing alright?” I ask, sitting down next to her. I embrace her but retract a little when I feel the cooling sweat on her skin. She doesn’t answer; instead, rivulets of tears pour down her face.
“No, I think I want to be alone at home for a while,” she says. She remains fixed in her seat, though, making no effort to stand up. Her rose‑patterned sundress has a rather low neckline, but her lack of a female figure keeps it from looking vulgar in such a conservative setting. Her chest is flat like a child’s, and her pale skin is almost translucent. She’s fixed her chest‑length auburn hair into a ballerina bun and is sitting next to Stephen. I can barely decipher between the two in the shade. I always find it more difficult to accept a red‑haired man than a woman, and I harassed Stephen mercilessly about it until about the tenth grade.
“We’re all wrapped up here, would you like me to drive you home?” Stephen leans toward her, his voice tender. I try to inconspicuously wipe my dampened hand with the Kleenex I’m still holding. I don’t want to seem too rude, but I feel it’s equally rude to let someone hold your hand when you’re sweating like a horse. I walk to the water cooler and pour chilled water into a Styrofoam cup and bring it back for her.
“Here, drink some water and rest for a little while. It’s stressful for all of us, but I think it ought to help,” I tell her. She takes the cup from me but doesn’t drink, almost deriving strength from holding it.
The door for the room I was in opens again and John sticks his head out. “Sorry to bother you guys but, seeing as you’re still here, would it be possible to speak to you for another moment, Stephen?”
“Uh, yeah, sure, I guess. I’ll just be a minute Sav. Maris, could you please sit with her for a while?” He follows John into the cramped interrogation room without waiting for a response.
She’s still sitting there, entirely immobile. While I understand that it’s quite a shock to have your friend go missing on a trip to
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
40
the lake, she’s had at least a day to process it, and it’s baffling to me that she’s still dumbfounded and is not in the least able to take care of herself. I don’t even think she and Carol were particularly close. I, on the other hand, have been friends with Carol almost since birth.
Her mother was in my mother’s little pregnancy group (in which they discussed the frivolities of giving birth and dressing up their future children, as well as sharing diet recipes so their baby weight wouldn’t last for any longer than it had to), and she went into labor about three days or so before Millie and I were born. They organized playdates for us that the nannies attended to. Mother was all about motherhood as long as it didn’t involve effort on her part. I spent a lot of time at Carol’s house when Father would be opening a new hotel in Barcelona, and Mother would be spending away her supposed stress in Monaco or New York. It was better to be with her and her loo‑loo mother than the succession of nannies that were hired to tackle the immense problem that was Millie and me—most quit after a couple of months. I have to give props to a large horsewoman who managed to deal with us for the entire summer back in 1965. I think she’s spending time in a sanatorium currently, but I think it’s more to do with her lack of equestrian success than her tenure at the Caldwell residence.
I reach into my pocketbook for the rest of Hunter’s cigarettes and light one. It’s this horrific cheap tobacco that makes the back of my throat burn, but it’ll have to do for now. “Susannah, take one. I promise it’ll help take the edge off.” She agrees, and I light it for her while I scan the place for an ashtray. I stare at the linoleum floor in silence, taking liberal puffs until the cigarette dissolves into ash. Susannah doesn’t speak, and Hunter looks like he’s been punched in the stomach. He’s blue as hell.
I don’t want to talk about Carol anymore. I don’t want to be with Susannah or Stephen or Hunter. I want to be back in bed so I can regain all the sleep I lost last night due to Hunter’s post‑sex sobbing about the poor missing girl. I am very aware of social etiquette: I know what to say and when to say it, but that
H o ne y traT R A p
41
doesn’t ease the burden of it. It takes time to develop a persona of empathy and concern, but I’m always there when a friend needs me, tissues and chocolates in hand. I don’t understand why people feel the way they do or what makes them attractive to one another, but I fulfill my obligations and my drive doesn’t allow me to be mediocre at anything, not even the illusion of compassion. It tires me out to no end. The only person who I understand and who understands me is Millie. If we’re not in the company of others we can communicate simply, effectively, without phony pleasantries. She serves many purposes for me, and I know how to placate her. Watching Mary Tyler Moore with my sister, followed by a nap would surely be preferable to this hell.
The fluorescent lights are too bright to agree with my hangover. I shift my gaze to the sketch of Ted that’s been tacked to a noticeboard in the center of the station. There’s apparently a task force that’s been created to track him down. It would help if their depiction looked even faintly like their suspect. King County PD never has been any good with their selection of sketch artists. The drawing of his car depicts a ’66 model VW bug, which his does not resemble.
I’m rather impatient, but the one thing Mother always taught us was composure. I know never to tap my foot against the floor or jiggle my leg or express any sort of inconvenience or discomfort. Every move, she taught us, should be deliberate, slow, and purposeful. She’d smack us about the face if we spoke while eating, slouched, disrupted someone’s conversation, wore clothes that were not year and style appropriate or used curse words. Crossing your legs at the knee was frowned upon and sitting with them apart was unfathomable. Composure allowed you extra time to decide your course of action and ensure it was entirely fitting. When someone gives you bad news or treats you poorly, you don’t jump to anger or insult. Instead, you note it down and file it in your mind for a time that will allow you to react with as much force as possible. Being polite and courteous
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
42
always works out as it gives you the benefit of the doubt (often when you don’t warrant that kind of luxury).
About forty‑five minutes later, Stephen walks out, visibly shaken. John must’ve worked quite a number on him. I knew he’d been holding back.
“Steph, dude, are you alright?” Hunter springs to his feet. “Have a seat, you look a little rickety.”

CHAPTER FOUR
I’ve always found that once you put a lot of effort into something, you don’t feel complete until you find a way to preserve it. Once you do it right, you don’t want to forget it. Some people like to keep photographs, but I like tangible mementos I can use to calm myself when the aching boredom rises, spreading malignantly from limb to limb, finger to finger, and toe to toe until it consumes me whole. I love a trophy almost as much as I love the hunt. I’m not an idiot. I know better than to cast suspicion on myself by striking too often. My family is perpetually bathed in publicity. Often, we’re subjected to intense scrutiny by those who couldn’t achieve a tenth of what we have. My mother is the head of damage control. She quashes anything remotely controversial before anyone can pick up the wave of a whisper. I’d prefer the police to an investigation headed by my mother, but I’ve learned to bypass both. I take a long shower and smoke a cigarette to its last ash. I dress slowly, deliberating between two pairs of shoes—I’m not sure which would look better with my billowing, cobalt Ossie Clark dress. I look to Millie, who’s dressed identically.
“Which shoes?” I ask her, taking a seat on the divan.
“Well, last time I came so close to twisting my ankle in those platforms, so I’m leaning toward flats,” she tells me, applying the finishing stroke of nail polish to her outstretched pinkie.
“We’re going to wear the Valentino ballet flats,” I say. The only other shoes that match our dresses are these hideous strappy sandals that should’ve never left the design studio. I grab Millie
44
by the shoulders and bring her to a standing position. I smooth her hair down and study her face for any discrepancies in makeup. She’s taller, but there’s little I can do about that with our shoe options. Other than height, it’s like looking into a mirror. “Millicent, you need to get your emotions under control, we can’t have any repeats.”
“I cried for literally less than a minute,” she tells me.
“You shouldn’t be crying at all. It’s so entertaining. I don’t know how it upsets you so much, honestly. Remember how the last one peed himself, it was hilarious. Messy but still hilarious.”
She isn’t moved, still bordering on hesitation. She always has reservations. She’s too scared of the blood. She’s too upset by the screams, and she can’t finish the job. She has no desire to have that kind of power. Well, wait, I don’t quite think it’s that—Millie wants power. She’s overcome by the idea of it, but she seeks it by other means. I don’t really understand because there’s no higher power than being in the position she’ll be in within a few hours. She needs to realize that her mediocre fantasies of control are just that—mediocre. Also, I’m no queen of comedy but seeing a man piss himself out of fear is pretty fucking funny.
I grab my eyeshadow palette and dab a little more cobalt on Millie’s closed lids. Her hand is trembling, and I hold it for a minute to steady her. “You need to get a grip, alright? You’re brilliant, and you won’t let this go down like a sinking ship. I need you; you know I can’t do it alone.” I kiss her on the forehead, making sure not to leave a trace of my cherry ChapStick on her skin. I can’t have her fucking this one up, too, but I need someone to work with me to make it a little easier. Being a five foot six, ninety‑five‑pound woman has its severe disadvantages, no matter what the women’s libbers may tell you. Men do tend to be larger, stronger—that’s why I never choose women as prey. I like a challenge. I planned this particular one before I left for Europe.
My instincts are animalistic, and I started early, watching as he headed to classes before midday on Mondays and returned from the gym at 5 PM on a Tuesday. He stayed home on Wednesdays and saw his girlfriend every Saturday, like clockwork. He lives
H o ne y traT R A p
45
on 12th Avenue, in the university district, with three other male roommates. They drink most evenings at Dante’s, and one of his roommates leaves the house every weekday morning at 5 AM, presumably because of a job, but I’ve yet to confirm this. He’s doing a Bachelor of Science at UW, and he’s in several of my biology classes. We don’t have any mutual friends, and though he’s made numerous passes at me, I’ve yet to take him up on any offers. It’s Monday, nearing 10 PM. I drove past his place a couple of times earlier today to confirm he was at home. Since returning from Europe, I needed to ensure his schedule was still the same, as it was important to factor in summer holidays. He was around most of the day, sunbathing on the front lawn with his shirt off. He’s one of the liberal types, with wavy, dirty blonde hair brushing his shoulders and a winning smile. His workouts show on his lithe frame and his deep brown eyes are flecked with amber. He seems to spend a lot of time on‑campus campaigning against supposed injustices overseas, more time than on his actual degree. He’s not particularly wealthy, but he certainly has no need for the socialism he crusades for. I could sleep with him. I could let him take me out on the date he’s been trying to organize for a few months now, but there’s something so repulsive about a consenting male.
“Get to the car quietly, Millie,” I tell her, my voice low. Mother seems to have the supersonic hearing abilities of a bat, despite the tranquilizers she consumes, and I don’t want a run‑in with her—especially before an event. There’s no way she’d let us leave.
“I know, I’m not clomping around like a Clydesdale,” she replies, rather brusquely. “I’m not going to screw it up this time.”
I search for my maroon Balenciaga shoulder purse. It has everything we’re going to need, and the bag does seem to go with my dress, despite the color clash. I tiptoe down the circular staircase and head straight for the garage. Millie is close behind, holding onto the fabric of my dress as if she were an infant finding strength to stand up for the first time. I decide not to tackle that issue just now. She hops into the back seat, and I slowly reverse
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
46
the car out of the driveway. I give her the bag. “Get the tire iron out now and put it on the floor.”
“I’ve got this, Maris.”
It’s an eighteen‑minute drive into downtown Seattle from Bellevue. I lived with a friend on twelfth for a couple of weeks, so I know the entire area by heart. It’s easy to navigate and fairly small. It’s a bustling college community, so I expect people to be largely absent, perhaps visiting their families. I don’t know very many people who stay around campus during the holidays, but James seems to be the aberration. I park across the street from his shabby share house, where I have an excellent vantage point. He has no drapes or blinds, so there’s an uninterrupted view into his living room and bedroom—he has exclusive access to the basement room too. I don’t want anyone to say they saw James and me speaking, but I know I’m going to have to muster up a conversation, however brief, in order to lure him into the car. He’s moving about the living room in faded blue bellbottoms and a plain white polo shirt. His hair is wet and slicked back, ostensibly from a recent shower. He sits for a while, watching a rather trite episode of Happy Days.
“Do you want some of the gin?” Millie asks from the cramped backseat. She swigs straight from the bottle, still quite jittery. She usually needs to consume a lot of alcohol or at least some cocaine or ketamine to go through with everything. Her nerves have to be steadied, but I need complete mental acuity. I want full control of my body, my emotions, and my target. I can’t do that if my brain is fogged with drugs or alcohol. It’s not often that I enjoy being stone‑cold sober, but this is definitely one of the rare occasions.
“No, you can have it. Don’t have too much. You know you get a little sloppy. Get down lower.”
I step onto the road softly, closing the door with as little noise as possible once I’ve scoped out the open windows facing his house. No one appears to be around or, if they are, they’re too busy watching poor quality television to pay attention. I hover outside his front lawn. I don’t want to be seen walking inside toward his house, but I look rather peculiar standing here. I walk
H o ne y traT R A p
47
to the door and knock twice, rapping my knuckles against the mahogany slates.
“Oh wow, hello,” he says, finally appearing. “What a lovely surprise. You look sensational.” He grins. He’s stoned.
“Hi! I’m so sorry to impose, but my friends bailed on me, and I thought you might’ve been home.”
“You’re not imposing at all, don’t be silly. Would you like to come in? The place is a bit of a mess, but you’re always welcome.”
“Well, I would love to, but I was wondering if maybe you wanted to get a drink first? I can’t quite bring myself to go drinking alone, you see.” I smile at him, placing my hand gently on his forearm.
“Yeah, of course, sure. Do you mind waiting for a second? I’ll go get a pullover quickly. It’s cooling down a little!”
“Sure, I’ll be out here.”
He takes a couple of minutes. I can hear him on the steps and then across the wooden floors. He dashes around and then grabs a set of keys from the drawer of a small table in the hallway. He shoves them into his front pocket and meets me on the stoop. I lead him toward the car, and he goes out of his way to open my door for me. He gets into the front passenger seat, oblivious to Millie’s presence in the backseat, as planned.
He sits down and straps his seatbelt across his chest. Millie strikes on command, crashing the tire iron against the back of his skull with immense force. His body goes limp, and I reach in the bag, searching. Millie grabs my hand, stopping me. She places the handcuffs in my outstretched palm. I handcuff him to the handle of the glove box on the dashboard and speed away from the curb. The wound on his head is bleeding, but he’s partially keeled over, so I don’t think it’ll leave stains. I cannot handle another trip to the carwash, sitting there and waiting for a fucking hour while the Mexicans dither about inefficiently.
I hurry to the I‑90 toward Issaquah. There’s a site ready. I made sure of it during the day. It’s a very secluded spot, bordered on all sides by wild bush and a small stream. One of our nannies used to take us hiking around there when Millie and I were very
K anikaANI K A B AT R A
48
small, and it’s beautifully peaceful. I’ve spent more time than I care to admit there, mapping it out and exploring the colorful bushland. It’s a large place, almost entirely enclosed by the large, overlapping trees. It’s perfect for my favorite hunting game. I’ve loaded the ketamine‑filled darts into the gun I bought in Japan last summer. It’s always more enjoyable when the male can last over an hour without yielding to the torpor—I like them spirited but not many are. It’s a little depressing when they fall over after a hit or two.
He rouses to consciousness during the trip. It’s funny sometimes what people will say in situations like this. I guess not particularly funny, I don’t mean I’d laugh in a literal sense, but it’s quite strange. He starts incoherently, his speech undecipherable from that of a two‑year‑old’s babble, and then starts talking about a math exam he has for a summer class at college. He’s asking if I’m there to help tutor him because he thinks he’s failing.
I hit the brakes and allow the car to roll to a mild stop. I grab the tire iron from the back and clout his skull again—he blacks out. I don’t have time for a conversation with him. The last thing I want is to hear him speak. Males talk too loudly, too long. It’s repelling. I don’t engage Millie in dialogue during the drive. She sits soundlessly in the back, and I spend the time reveling in the overwhelming pleasure and thrill. Adrenaline is pulsating throughout my body, enveloping me whole. My heart thuds in my chest, quick but steady. This is familiar territory.
The site isn’t quite designed for automobile access, but I manage to drive through some of the less dense brush. He’s still out cold. Millie and I exit the car—I unlock his handcuffs. I leave the door open. I want him to think he has a chance to escape. I would have liked to sleep with him. He’s certainly pretty, and there’s nothing better than knowing you’re going to be his last. The power trip is like an orgasm, morphine, and money combined. It’s dubious, now, though, with Millie here.
It’s a long wait until he wakes again. He’s like a caged animal, disoriented and terrified. His eyes dart around, sussing out the situation. I watch as the panic sets in, slowly at first, then frantic.

I’m perched in a low hanging tree cove, my legs dangling and the dart gun in my lap. Millie is across from me, on the other side of the semi‑forest, invisible to the untrained eye. She’s got a sturdy white rope with her—it’s usually used to dock Father’s yacht. I’m in the leotard I wore under my dress, which lies folded neatly in the trunk of the car. I see him stumble and fall out of the car, with blood gushing from his head. He crawls around for a little while, endeavoring to gather himself. I think he’s crying, but my vision is a little obstructed from the dark, and I can’t see all that clearly. When he manages to get to his feet he stumbles and sways, grabbing his head with one hand. He breaks into a clumsy run, limbs moving awkwardly. He manages to gain a little speed. I shoot him in the leg, and he tumbles down, screaming in pain.
“I like that you’re trying,” I call to him, laughing. Millie lets out a little panicked giggle too.
“Wh‑why are you doing this?” he asks me, clutching his leg and sobbing.
“We all need to have a little fun sometimes, James.” I shoot him in the arm. At this point, ketamine will be flooding his veins. He’ll get respite from the pain and if he’s lucky, he may slip into a k‑hole and start thinking this is all a hallucination. He lies quite still and then shudders repeatedly. He manages to make it back to his feet, and he starts running again, this time toward Millie. He seems to have a fair amount of fight in him and it’s wonderfully entertaining. I shoot him in the back. He falls over.
“Keep trying, please,” says Millie, laughing harder now. I’m not sure if the thrill has made her giddy or if she’s refraining from crying. Millie often laughs when she’s suppressing tears. He staggers toward her, uncomprehendingly noticing that she’s there. I think it’s only now dawning on him that there are two of us. I don’t even find it strange. I did, after all, go out of my way to make sure there were no visible differences. I give him a minute to realize he’s not getting out of here and then shoot him in the chest. I hop down from the tree and walk to him. He’s fallen again, but
