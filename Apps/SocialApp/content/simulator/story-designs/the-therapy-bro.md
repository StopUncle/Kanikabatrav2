# The Therapy Bro / Wellness Queen

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: Premium
- **Difficulty**: Advanced
- **Estimated Scenes**: 26-32
- **Placement**: BOTH men's and women's sections (unisex)
- **Category**: Covert manipulation, weaponized therapy-speak

---

## Logline

Your partner of 8 months has "done the work" - they meditate daily, attend therapy weekly, and speak fluent psychology. So why do you feel more confused, more anxious, and more wrong with every passing day?

---

## Core Theme

**The weaponization of therapeutic language as a tool of control.** This scenario exposes how evolved-sounding people can use therapy-speak to:
- Dismiss your concerns as "projections"
- Reframe their bad behavior as "setting boundaries"
- Make every conflict about YOUR unhealed trauma
- Use vulnerability performances to reset after harm
- Create an intellectual maze where you're always the problem

The hardest manipulators to spot are the ones who sound like they're quoting your therapist.

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### The "Evolved" Manipulator
Unlike obvious red flags, this person SOUNDS healthy:
- Uses "I feel" statements (to accuse you)
- References attachment theory (to pathologize your needs)
- Talks about "holding space" (while taking up all of it)
- Practices "radical honesty" (about YOUR flaws)
- Claims "boundaries" (to control your behavior)

### Therapy-Speak Manipulation Tactics

1. **The Projection Flip**: "I think you're projecting your trauma onto me"
2. **The Boundary Shield**: "I'm setting a boundary around your energy right now"
3. **The Spiritual Bypass**: "I've processed this. Why are you still holding on?"
4. **The Diagnosis Drop**: "This sounds like your anxious attachment talking"
5. **The Growth Gatekeep**: "I'm in a different place in my healing journey"
6. **The Vulnerability Reset**: Crying/sharing trauma to derail accountability
7. **The Journaling Gaslight**: "That's not what my therapist and I discussed"
8. **The Regulation Blame**: "You're dysregulated. I can't talk to you like this"

### Key Lesson
Real therapy teaches self-reflection and mutual respect. Weaponized therapy-speak always ends with YOU being the problem and THEM being the victim of your "unhealed parts."

---

## Characters

### Sage (The Manipulator)
**Presentation**: Calm, centered, spiritually "evolved"
- Meditates every morning, sometimes twice
- Has a therapist, a life coach, AND a spiritual advisor
- Plant-based, yoga-bodied, soft-spoken
- Speaks slowly, deliberately, like everything is profound
- Instagram aesthetic: morning sunlight, journals, wellness

**Reality**:
- Uses therapeutic framework to always be right
- Their "boundaries" only flow one direction
- Gets cold and punishing when challenged
- Weaponizes vulnerability to escape accountability
- Believes their "work" makes them superior

**Manipulation Style**: Intellectual, covert, makes you question yourself. Never yells - just gets "disappointed" in your "regression."

**Voice Example**:
> "I hear that you're having a reaction. I'm wondering if this is about me, or if something from your past is being activated right now?"

**Emotion Patterns**:
- `neutral` → default guru calm
- `concerned` → performing empathy before blame
- `sad` → vulnerability weapon
- `cold` → punishment for not accepting their frame
- `seductive` → love-bombing after conflict

### Drew (Reality-Check Friend)
The friend who sees through the wellness facade.

**Role**:
- Notices you've become smaller, more apologetic
- Points out the one-way nature of Sage's "growth"
- Asks uncomfortable questions about who's actually changing

**Voice Example**:
> "When's the last time Sage admitted they were wrong? Like actually wrong, not 'I could have communicated my boundaries more clearly' wrong?"

**Emotion Patterns**:
- `neutral` → observation mode
- `concerned` → worried about you
- `frustrated` → when you defend Sage's bullshit

### Your Therapist (Optional - Phone Scenes)
Brief appearances via text or phone. Provides actual therapeutic perspective that contrasts with Sage's weaponized version.

**Role**: Asks questions that make you think, never tells you what to do

**Voice Example**:
> "It sounds like you're doing a lot of work to understand their perspective. I'm curious - what would they say YOUR perspective is?"

## Detailed Scene Breakdown

### PART 1: THE PERFECT PARTNER

#### Scene 1: Sunday Morning
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: Peaceful morning. Sage finishing meditation.

```
SAGE: [serene, eyes still closed]
"Just... one more breath."

[They open their eyes, smile warmly at you]

SAGE: [happy]
"Good morning, beautiful soul. How did you sleep?"

NARRATION:
Eight months with Sage. Eight months of morning meditations,
evening gratitude lists, and the calmest relationship you've ever had.

INNER VOICE: [concerned]
Why does "calm" sometimes feel like "walking on eggshells"?
```

**Choice 1**:
1. "I slept okay. Had weird dreams." - Share honestly
2. "Great! Should I make breakfast?" - Redirect to action
3. "Fine." - Keep it light

*All paths continue similarly, this is setup.*

---

#### Scene 2: The Brunch Invitation
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: Friend invites you to brunch. Sage responds.

```
[You check your phone]

YOU:
"Maya wants to do brunch next Saturday. Girls' thing."

SAGE: [neutral, measured pause]
"Hmm."

[Sage sets down their tea deliberately]

SAGE: [concerned]
"I notice I'm having a reaction to that. Can I share?"

INNER VOICE: [neutral]
A reaction to... brunch?
```

**Choice 2**:
1. "Of course." - Open the floor
2. "It's just brunch with friends." - Light pushback
3. "What kind of reaction?" - Question the framing

**Path A (Choice 1 - Open the floor)**:
```
SAGE: [sad, vulnerable]
"I've been feeling disconnected from you lately.
Weekends are our time to really be present together.

When I hear you making plans without checking in first,
I notice my nervous system responding."

[pause]

SAGE:
"I'm not saying don't go. I'm just naming what's coming up for me."

INNER VOICE: [concerned]
They're not saying don't go. But somehow you feel like you shouldn't.
```

**Path B (Choice 2 - Light pushback)**:
```
SAGE: [neutral, slight cooling]
"I hear that you're framing it that way."

[pause]

SAGE:
"I wonder if you're feeling defensive because some part of you
knows this pattern - prioritizing external validation over
our container."

INNER VOICE: [confused]
Did you... do something wrong?
```

---

#### Scene 3: The Reframe
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: Continuing the brunch conversation.

```
SAGE:
"I'm not trying to control you. That would be codependent.

I'm just sharing my experience. What you do with that
information is entirely your choice."

[They pick up their tea, serene again]

SAGE: [neutral]
"I trust you to make the decision that honors our relationship."

INNER VOICE: [concerned]
It's your choice. But only one choice is "honoring the relationship."
```

**Choice 3**:
1. "I'll tell Maya another time." - Comply (+15 SAGE_GRIP, -10 SELF_TRUST)
2. "I want to go, but let's plan something for Sunday?" - Compromise (+5 SAGE_GRIP)
3. "I'm going to brunch. We can connect after." - Hold the plan (+10 SELF_TRUST, +10 CLARITY, FLAG: held_boundary_once)
4. "You just said you're not controlling me, but this feels like control." - Call it out (+15 CLARITY, triggers confrontation mini-scene)

---

#### Scene 4: The First Crack (Transition varies by Scene 3 choice)

**If held boundary or called out**:
```
[Sage's energy shifts. Barely perceptible. A coolness.]

SAGE: [neutral, but colder]
"I appreciate your honesty. Growth isn't always comfortable."

[They stand, begin making breakfast. Silence.]

SAGE:
"I'm going to take some space to process this.
I'll be in the other room."

INNER VOICE:
"Taking space." Is that healthy boundaries or punishment?
```

**If complied**:
```
SAGE: [happy, warm]
"Thank you for being present with me. This is what secure
attachment looks like."

[They move closer, touch your face]

SAGE: [seductive]
"I'm so lucky to be with someone who does the work."

NARRATION:
It feels good. The warmth. The validation.

INNER VOICE: [concerned]
So why do you also feel... smaller?
```

---

#### Scene 5: Drew's Observation
**Location**: coffee-shop
**Setup**: Catching up with Drew a few days later.

```
DREW: [neutral, observing]
"So you didn't go to Maya's brunch?"

YOU:
"We talked about it and decided weekends should be
more intentional about connection time."

DREW: [raises eyebrow]
"'We' decided? Or Sage 'shared their experience'
and you decided?"

[pause]

DREW:
"I've noticed you do that now. Say 'we' for things
that sound a lot like 'Sage.'"
```

**Choice 4**:
1. "That's not fair. Sage is really emotionally intelligent." - Defend
2. "You don't know them like I do." - Deflect
3. [Stay quiet] - Let it land
4. "What do you mean?" - Explore (FLAG: drew_reality_check, +10 CLARITY)

**Path D (Explore)**:
```
DREW: [concerned]
"Before Sage, you were... louder. More certain.

Now everything you say sounds like you're quoting
a self-help book. And you're always apologizing."

[pause]

DREW:
"When's the last time Sage apologized? Like actually.
Not 'I'm sorry you felt that way' but 'I was wrong.'"

INNER VOICE:
...When WAS that?
```

---

#### Scene 6: The Accountability Dodge
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: You bring up something Sage did that bothered you.

```
YOU:
"I wanted to talk about last night. When we were
with your friends, you corrected me three times
about stuff that didn't matter."

SAGE: [neutral, settling in]
"I hear you. Thank you for bringing this to me.
I want to understand your experience."

[pause]

SAGE:
"When you say 'corrected' - can you tell me
what that brought up for you?"

INNER VOICE: [confused]
Wait. This is about what THEY did.
```

**Choice 5**:
1. "It made me feel small and embarrassed." - Answer their question
2. "I want to talk about the correcting, not my reaction." - Stay on topic (+15 CLARITY)
3. "Maybe I'm being too sensitive." - Self-doubt (-10 SELF_TRUST, +15 SAGE_GRIP)

**Path A (Answer their question)**:
```
SAGE: [concerned, nodding]
"Small. Embarrassed. Those are big feelings."

[They lean in]

SAGE:
"I'm curious - does this remind you of anything
from your childhood? A parent, maybe?"

INNER VOICE:
How did this become about your parents?

SAGE: [gentle]
"Sometimes we project old wounds onto present relationships.
I'm not saying that's what's happening, but..."

YOU:
"But?"

SAGE: [sad, vulnerable]
"I grew up with a lot of criticism too.
That's why I've worked so hard on conscious communication.

It hurts to hear that my attempts to share information
are landing as 'corrections.'"

INNER VOICE:
Now THEY'RE the victim. Impressive.
```

---

### PART 2: THE FOG

#### Scene 7: The Growing Doubt
**Location**: phone-call (internal monologue heavy)
**Setup**: Middle of the night. You can't sleep.

```
NARRATION:
3:47 AM. You've been staring at the ceiling for an hour.

Tomorrow you need to tell Sage their
comment about your job hurt you.

INNER VOICE:
They said you were "playing small" with your career.
That's... feedback, right?

NARRATION:
You rehearse the conversation. Every version
ends with you apologizing for something.

INNER VOICE:
Maybe you ARE playing small. Maybe they're right.

[pause]

Or maybe that's what they want you to think.
```

*Transition scene - no choices.*

---

#### Scene 8: The Journal Entry
**Location**: text-screen (your notes app)
**Setup**: You've started documenting.

```
NARRATION:
You open your notes app. The private one.

[Screen shows text:]

"May 15 - S said I was 'self-sabotaging' when I wanted
to see my sister. We talked for an hour. I ended up
not going. Not sure how that happened.

May 18 - Brought up the work comment. S cried about
their own career trauma. I comforted them.
Never actually discussed my feelings.

May 22 - S called my reaction to their lateness
'controlling.' They were 2 hours late.
I had said 'I wish you'd texted.'

May 24 - Am I crazy?"

INNER VOICE:
You're not crazy. You're documenting.
```

**Choice 6**:
1. Keep writing (+10 CLARITY, FLAG: documentation_started)
2. Delete it - Sage says journaling negativity reinforces it (-10 SELF_TRUST)
3. Send it to Drew (+15 CLARITY, FLAG: drew_reality_check)

---

#### Scene 9: The Vulnerability Weapon
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: You've decided to hold firm on something. Sage deploys vulnerability.

```
YOU:
"I'm not comfortable with how you talked about me
at the dinner party. You made a joke about my 'control issues'
and everyone laughed."

SAGE: [neutral, measured]
"I hear you. That sounds painful."

[long pause]

SAGE: [sad, crumbling]
"I... I have to be honest with you."

[They look away, eyes welling]

SAGE:
"My therapist and I have been working on something.
About my father."

INNER VOICE:
Here it comes.

SAGE: [sad, genuine-seeming]
"He used to humiliate me in public. Make everyone laugh at me.

When you say I did that to you...
I can't breathe."

[They're crying now]

SAGE:
"I would never. I would NEVER do that to someone I love."
```

**Choice 7**:
1. Comfort them - they're clearly in pain (-15 CLARITY, +20 SAGE_GRIP)
2. "I'm sorry you went through that. But that doesn't change what happened." (+20 CLARITY, FLAG: vulnerability_trap_avoided)
3. "Maybe we should talk about this later." - Retreat
4. Let them cry, say nothing (allows you to observe their reaction)

**Path D (Observe)**:
```
NARRATION:
You don't move. Don't speak.

The crying continues. Then slowly... stops.

SAGE: [cold, sudden shift]
"So you're just going to sit there?"

INNER VOICE:
There it is. Under the tears.
Something cold. Something watching.

SAGE: [neutral, recovering]
"I'm going to take a walk. I need to regulate."

[They leave]

NARRATION:
The door closes. The apartment feels very quiet.

INNER VOICE:
That wasn't vulnerability. That was a test.
And you didn't perform.
```

---

#### Scene 10: The Therapist Contrast
**Location**: phone-call
**Setup**: Optional scene if player has been documenting.

```
THERAPIST: [phone, calm]
"You mentioned Sage talks about attachment styles a lot.
What does YOUR attachment style become in these conversations?"

YOU:
"I don't know. Wrong?"

THERAPIST:
"Interesting. What does Sage's become?"

YOU:
"Secure. They always say they're secure."

THERAPIST:
"Mm. In my experience, people who announce their
secure attachment frequently tend to be..."

[pause]

THERAPIST:
"Well. What do you think?"

INNER VOICE:
People who are actually secure don't need to keep saying it.
```

---

### PART 3: THE CLARITY

#### Scene 11: The Pattern Revealed
**Location**: coffee-shop
**Setup**: Drew lays it out.

```
DREW:
"I made a list. Want to see it?"

YOU:
"A list of what?"

DREW: [slides phone across table]
"Every time you've mentioned Sage using a therapy word
to end a conversation where they were wrong."

[Screen shows:]
- "projection" - 4 times
- "triggered" - 7 times
- "boundary" - 12 times
- "dysregulated" - 6 times
- "secure attachment" - 5 times

DREW:
"Notice anything?"

INNER VOICE:
They're using your language against you.

DREW:
"These words mean something. They're supposed to
help people understand each other.

Sage uses them to WIN."
```

---

#### Scene 12: The Confrontation Decision
**Location**: apartment (your mind)
**Setup**: Major branching point.

```
NARRATION:
You have a choice.

INNER VOICE:
You can confront Sage directly. Call out the pattern.
They're smart. It won't be easy.

Or you can start extracting. Quietly. Carefully.

Or you can give them another chance.
Maybe they don't know they're doing it.

Which kind of clarity are you ready for?
```

**Choice 8 - MAJOR BRANCH**:
1. CONFRONT: "We need to talk about how you use therapy language." → Branch A
2. EXTRACT: Begin quietly distancing, test their reaction → Branch B
3. ONE MORE CHANCE: Give them an opportunity to self-reflect → Branch C
4. EXIT NOW: "I think we should break up." → Branch D (fast ending)

---

### BRANCH A: THE CONFRONTATION

#### Scene A1: Setting the Stage
**Location**: apartment

```
[You wait until Sage is settled, grounded, in a good mood]

YOU:
"I need to talk about something. Can you just listen
for a minute before responding?"

SAGE: [neutral, slight wariness]
"Of course. I'm here."

YOU:
"I've noticed a pattern. When I bring up something
that bothers me about us, we end up talking about
my trauma, my reactions, my patterns.

But we never actually talk about what YOU did."

[Sage's face flickers. Recognition. Then control.]

SAGE: [measured]
"I appreciate you sharing that. Can I respond now?"
```

**Choice A1**:
1. "Yes." - Let them respond (tests if you can hold your frame)
2. "I'm not done." - Keep control (+10 CLARITY)
3. "I know what you're going to say." - Predict their tactics (+20 CLARITY if correct)

---

#### Scene A2: Their Response
**Location**: apartment

```
SAGE: [calm, slower than normal]
"What I'm hearing is that you feel unheard.
That's valid. That's really valid."

[pause]

SAGE:
"I wonder though... and please receive this with love...

If the reason you feel unheard is because
my insights are landing too close to truth?"

INNER VOICE:
There it is. You're the problem again.

SAGE: [concerned]
"Trauma can make us resist exactly what we need to hear."

YOU:
"And what about YOUR trauma? The one you bring up
every time I try to hold you accountable?"
```

---

#### Scene A3: The Mask Slips
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: If player stays firm, Sage's veneer cracks.

```
SAGE: [flash of cold]
"I don't appreciate being psychoanalyzed."

INNER VOICE:
Interesting. THEY don't like it.

YOU:
"That's what you do to me. Every conversation."

SAGE: [cold, controlled]
"This is exactly what I was worried about.
You're not ready for real growth.

You want to stay comfortable in your patterns."

[They stand]

SAGE:
"I need space. This conversation is no longer
productive for my nervous system."

INNER VOICE:
Watch them leave. The martyrdom of the evolved.
```

---

### BRANCH B: THE QUIET EXTRACTION

#### Scene B1: Testing the Theory
**Location**: apartment

```
NARRATION:
Instead of confronting, you start testing. Subtly.

[Next few days play out]

NARRATION:
You stop apologizing first after disagreements.
You wait to see what Sage does.

Day 1: They're pleasant. Slightly cooler.
Day 2: They ask if something's wrong. You say no.
Day 3: They accuse you of "withdrawing."

SAGE: [concerned]
"I can feel your energy pulling back.
Are you self-protecting right now?"

INNER VOICE:
You set a boundary without words. And they noticed immediately.
```

---

#### Scene B2: The Hoover Begins
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: Sage senses the shift, escalates intimacy.

```
[Sage comes home with flowers, your favorite takeout]

SAGE: [happy, warm]
"I've been thinking about us. About how lucky I am."

[They set everything down, take your hands]

SAGE: [seductive, earnest]
"I know I can get caught up in my own processing.
You make me want to be better."

INNER VOICE:
This is the reset. The love bomb before the next freeze.

SAGE:
"Let's plan a trip. Just us.
No phones, no distractions.
Pure connection."
```

**Choice B1**:
1. Accept the offer - maybe they're changing (-10 CLARITY, resets progress)
2. "That sounds nice. Let's talk about it tomorrow." - Noncommittal (+5 CLARITY)
3. "I appreciate this, but I need to understand why this keeps cycling." - Name the pattern (+20 CLARITY)
4. "I think we need to take a break." - Exit option

---

### BRANCH C: ONE MORE CHANCE

#### Scene C1: The Test
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: You give Sage an explicit opportunity to self-reflect.

```
YOU:
"Sage, I want to ask you something.
And I need you to really think before answering."

SAGE: [neutral, attentive]
"Of course."

YOU:
"In the eight months we've been together,
can you think of a time you were genuinely wrong
about something between us?

Not 'I could have communicated better.'
Actually wrong. About a fact. About your behavior."

[Long pause. Sage blinks. You can see them searching.]

SAGE:
"I... that's a lot of pressure."

INNER VOICE:
Not really. Most people could name one.
```

---

#### Scene C2: Their Answer
**Location**: apartment

```
SAGE: [thoughtful, or performing thoughtful]
"I think... I can be too focused on growth sometimes.

I push because I see your potential."

YOU:
"That's not what I asked."

SAGE: [slight coldness]
"I'm trying to be vulnerable here.
You asked me to self-reflect and I am."

YOU:
"No. You're reframing. Again.

I asked when you were WRONG.
You told me when you were TOO good at something."

[Sage's eyes harden]

INNER VOICE:
There's your answer.
```

---

## Endings

### GOOD ENDINGS

**1. Clear-Eyed Exit**
**Trigger**: CLARITY > 70, called out therapy-speak at least once, held boundary twice

```
NARRATION:
You end it clearly. Cleanly.

YOU:
"I've learned a lot about psychology from you.
Mostly about how it can be weaponized.

I need to leave now. Please don't contact me."

[Sage opens their mouth, closes it. The therapy words fail them.]

INNER VOICE:
You learned their language. Then you left anyway.

That's the only way to win with someone
who's turned healing into a game.
```

---

**2. The Documentation Exit**
**Trigger**: documentation_started, drew_reality_check, therapist_consulted

```
NARRATION:
Three months later, Drew reads a text from you.

DREW: [reading]
"The journaling saved me. Every time I doubted myself,
I went back to the pattern. Black and white."

[Drew types back]

"Proud of you."

NARRATION:
Sage has a new partner now.
One who's "really doing the work."

You hope they keep a journal too.
```

---

**3. The Vocabulary Breakthrough**
**Trigger**: VOCABULARY_AWARE > 7, caught_projection_flip, called_out_therapy_speak

```
NARRATION:
You know the words now. You can hear them coming.

"Projection." (Dismissal)
"Boundary." (Control)
"Secure attachment." (Superiority)
"Your trauma." (Not my problem)

YOU:
"I'm leaving. And I'm taking the vocabulary with me."

[You use it differently now. To protect, not to win.]

INNER VOICE:
Language is a tool. Some people build with it.
Some people bury.

You learned the difference.
```

---

### NEUTRAL ENDINGS

**4. The Slow Fade**
**Trigger**: Chose extraction path, avoided confrontation, some clarity gained

```
NARRATION:
You never had the big talk.
You just... drifted.

SAGE:
"I feel you pulling away."

YOU:
"Maybe we've grown in different directions."

NARRATION:
You didn't call out the pattern.
But you escaped it.

Partial credit. You're still confused sometimes.
But at least you're confused alone.
```

---

**5. The Cycle Continues**
**Trigger**: Gave more than one chance, some clarity but not enough

```
NARRATION:
You try again. And again.

Each time they say the right things.
Each time something doesn't change.

INNER VOICE:
Some lessons take longer.

NARRATION:
You'll figure it out eventually.
Hopefully before too much more time passes.
```

---

### BAD ENDINGS

**6. The Full Inversion**
**Trigger**: SELF_TRUST < 30, bought into therapy-speak frame

```
SAGE: [warm, mentorly]
"I'm so proud of how you're growing."

NARRATION:
You nod. They ARE right, probably.
You WERE projecting.
You DO have anxious attachment.
You ARE lucky they're so patient.

[Later, on the phone with Drew]

DREW:
"Hey, are you okay? You sound..."

YOU:
"I'm doing the work. Sage says I'm making progress."

[Drew goes quiet]

INNER VOICE:
[This space intentionally left silent.]
```

---

**7. The Discard**
**Trigger**: Challenged Sage without enough preparation, didn't document

```
SAGE: [cold]
"I've done everything I can.
But I can't love someone through their resistance to growth.

I need to protect my peace."

NARRATION:
They leave. And somehow, you feel like
they're the victim.

You spend months wondering what you did wrong.
What unhealed part of you pushed them away.

INNER VOICE:
It'll take years to untangle this.
```

---

**8. The "Growth" Prison**
**Trigger**: Stayed, internalized all blame, SAGE_GRIP > 80

```
NARRATION:
Two years later.

You speak differently now. Slower.
More careful. Every word chosen to avoid
activating someone else's wound.

YOUR VOICE:
"I'm working on it. My therapist says
I have work to do around my critical parent."

[Sage smiles, satisfied]

NARRATION:
You've become fluent in the language.

But you can't remember the last time
you said something just because it was true.

INNER VOICE:
[No inner voice. It went quiet a long time ago.]
```

'seductive_after_conflict' = reset behavior
```

### Key Dialogue Patterns to Implement

```typescript
// Projection flip
"I wonder if this is your [trauma/attachment/pattern] talking"

// Boundary shield
"I'm going to take space to regulate"

// Vulnerability weapon
"When you say that, it activates my [childhood wound]"

// Diagnosis drop
"This sounds like anxious attachment"

// Growth gatekeep
"I've processed this. Why are you still holding onto it?"
```

## Voice Guide Summary

### Sage
- Always measured, never rushed
- Speaks in "I" statements and observations
- Gets colder when challenged, not louder
- Uses pauses deliberately
- Recovers quickly with warmth after getting what they want

### Drew
- Direct, doesn't use therapy-speak
- Asks uncomfortable questions
- Gets frustrated when you defend Sage
- Never tells you what to do, just presents evidence

### Inner Voice
- Brief gut observations
- Questions that make player think
- Contrasts what's said with what's felt
- Goes quieter in bad endings (chilling effect)

## Critical Scenes Checklist

- [ ] Brunch boundary test (early)
- [ ] Accountability dodge (they deflect, you question)
- [ ] Vulnerability weapon (they cry to derail)
- [ ] Drew reality check (pattern named externally)
- [ ] Therapist contrast (what real therapy sounds like)
- [ ] The one chance (ask for ONE time they were wrong)
- [ ] Mask slip moment (cold underneath the calm)
- [ ] Major branch point (confront/extract/chance/exit)
- [ ] Resolution appropriate to stats
