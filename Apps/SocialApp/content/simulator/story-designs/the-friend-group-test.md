# The Friend Group Test

## Meta Information
- **Tier**: Premium
- **Difficulty**: Advanced
- **Estimated Scenes**: 30-36
- **Placement**: BOTH men's and women's sections (unisex)
- **Category**: Social manipulation, flying monkeys, isolation tactics

---

## Logline

You've been dating Reese for four months. Tonight, you finally meet "the group" - five friends who've known each other since college. By midnight, you'll know if you passed their tests... and whether you even want to.

---

## Core Theme

**The social machinery of manipulation.** This scenario exposes how friend groups can become:
- Extensions of a manipulator's control
- Information networks (reporting your behavior)
- Loyalty testing grounds
- Vehicles for triangulation
- Social proof of "you're the problem"

The hardest part of leaving some relationships isn't the partner - it's the entire social world built around them.

---

## Psychology Being Taught

### Flying Monkey Dynamics
Friends who serve the manipulator's agenda, consciously or not:
- **The Reporter**: Tells Reese everything you say/do
- **The Enforcer**: Punishes deviation from group norms
- **The Triangulator**: Creates jealousy and competition
- **The Validator**: Constantly confirms Reese's narrative
- **The Recruiter**: Love-bombs you into the fold

### Group Manipulation Tactics

1. **The Loyalty Test**: Situations designed to see whose "side" you're on
2. **The Inside Joke Freeze-Out**: Using shared history to exclude
3. **The Information Extraction**: Casual questions that get reported back
4. **The Comparison Game**: Subtle mentions of exes or "better" behavior
5. **The Group Opinion**: "We all think..." as pressure
6. **The Conditional Inclusion**: Warmth when compliant, ice when not
7. **The Triangulation Setup**: Creating jealousy through "harmless" flirting
8. **The Exit Block**: "Don't break up the group" pressure

### Key Lesson
Healthy friend groups welcome new people. Toxic ones test them. The difference is whether you feel like you're auditioning... or arriving.

---

## Characters

### Reese (Your Partner)
**Presentation**: Charming, social, the glue of the group
- Everyone loves Reese - they're the energy of every gathering
- Funny, charismatic, knows how to work a room
- Talks about "the group" constantly - they're family

**Reality**:
- Uses the group as surveillance and control
- Has conditioned friends to report and enforce
- Gets cold when you don't perform well socially
- Frames your discomfort as "not being a good fit"

**Manipulation Style**: Social. Uses the group as extensions of their will. Never directly cruel - lets the group do the work.

**Voice Example**:
> "Everyone's so excited to meet you! Just be yourself. Well, maybe a little less intense than usual - Kai can be sensitive."

**Emotion Patterns**:
- `happy` → performing for the group
- `seductive` → reward for passing tests
- `cold` → punishment for "embarrassing" them
- `concerned` → fake worry about your "fit"

### The Friend Group

#### Kai (The Reporter)
Reese's "best friend." Sweet, curious, asks lots of questions.

**Role**: Everything you tell Kai goes directly to Reese.

**Tell**: Asks slightly too probing questions, always steers conversation to your opinions about Reese.

**Voice Example**:
> "So how are things going with you two? Really going? You can tell me, I won't say anything."

---

#### Morgan (The Enforcer)
Protective of Reese, suspicious of newcomers.

**Role**: Makes you feel like you're always being evaluated. Punishes missteps with coldness.

**Tell**: Watches your interactions with Reese closely. Mentions exes who "didn't work out."

**Voice Example**:
> "Reese's last partner didn't really get our group dynamic either. Took like eight months before we warmed up. If we ever did."

---

#### Ellis (The Triangulator)
Flirty, touchy, has "history" with Reese.

**Role**: Creates jealousy and insecurity. Makes you wonder if there's still something there.

**Tell**: Too comfortable touching Reese. Inside jokes that exclude you. "Remember that night in Cabo?"

**Voice Example**:
> "Oh my god, Reese, remember when we—" [notices you] "—sorry, you had to be there. Anyway."

---

#### Parker (The Validator)
Sweet, conflict-averse, always agrees with Reese.

**Role**: Makes Reese seem universally adored. "Everyone thinks..."

**Tell**: Never disagrees with Reese. Looks to Reese before offering opinions.

**Voice Example**:
> "Reese is seriously the best. Like, the BEST. We're all so protective because we know how special they are."

---

#### Avery (The Potential Ally)
Newest to the group besides you. Slightly on the outside.

**Role**: The one person who might see what you see.

**Tell**: Shares knowing looks. Sometimes seems uncomfortable with group dynamics.

**Voice Example**:
> "It can be a lot at first. The group, I mean. They're intense. But they mean well. I think."

---

### Jamie (Your Outside Friend)
Your reality check. NOT part of the group.

**Role**:
- Asks why you're changing to fit in
- Points out what healthy friend groups look like
- Available via text throughout

**Voice Example**:
> "Wait, they quizzed you about your job and your ex in the first hour? That's not 'getting to know you.' That's reconnaissance."

people on earth."

[adjusts their outfit]

REESE:
"Just... a few things."

[turns to face you]

REESE: [neutral]
"Kai can be sensitive. Don't bring up anything too political.
Morgan takes a while to warm up - don't take it personally.
And Ellis..."

[pause, something flickers]

REESE: [casual, too casual]
"Ellis is just flirty with everyone. It's nothing."

INNER VOICE:
That's three warnings. Before you've even met them.
```

REESE: [happy, performance mode]
"Everyone! This is [you]!"

[Chorus of greetings. Too warm. Too synchronized.]

KAI: [happy, arms open]
"We've heard SO much about you. Get over here!"

[Kai hugs you slightly too long]

MORGAN: [neutral, evaluating]
"Finally. The mysterious one."

INNER VOICE:
Why does 'finally' feel like a test you're already late for?
```

*Transition - no choice, just landing.*

---

#### Scene 3: The Seating Arrangement
**Location**: restaurant

```
[You look for a seat. There are two options:]

NARRATION:
There's an empty chair next to Reese. Safe.
And one between Kai and Ellis. In the deep end.

REESE: [watching]
"Sit wherever!"

[But you feel eyes on you]

ELLIS: [seductive, patting the chair]
"Come sit by us. We don't bite."

[slight smirk]

"Much."

INNER VOICE:
The easy choice is next to Reese. The test is clearly over there.
```

KAI: [curious, warm]
"So! Tell us everything. How'd you two meet?"

[You share the story]

KAI:
"Adorable. And what do you do?"

[You answer]

KAI:
"Amazing. And where did you grow up? Any siblings?
When was your last relationship? Why did it end?"

INNER VOICE:
That escalated fast.

MORGAN: [neutral, watching]
"Kai. Let them breathe."

KAI: [laughing]
"Sorry! I'm just a curious person. Ignore me."

PARKER:
"The LOBSTER!"

MORGAN: [actually laughing]
"I still can't believe they didn't kick us out."

REESE: [wiping tears]
"We were SO young."

[You sit there, smiling. Not understanding.]

ELLIS: [glancing at you]
"You had to be there."

[pause]

"Anyway."

[The conversation resumes without you]

That 'anyway' was a door closing.

```
[You glance at Avery. They're smiling, but it doesn't reach their eyes.]

AVERY: [small shrug, almost imperceptible]

INNER VOICE:
Noted. There might be one person here who understands.
```

---

#### Scene 6: Reese Disappears
**Location**: restaurant
**Setup**: The real test begins.

```
REESE: [standing]
"I need to take this - work thing."

[They look at you, squeeze your shoulder]

REESE: [happy]
"Be right back. You're in good hands."

[They walk away]

NARRATION:
The table shifts. Like predators noticing prey is alone.

MORGAN: [neutral]
"So. Now that it's just us."

#### Scene 7: The Ex Mention
**Location**: restaurant

```
MORGAN:
"I ask because we've seen Reese hurt before."

[meaningful look around the table]

"Their last partner, Alex, seemed great at first too."

ELLIS: [sipping drink]
"Oh god. Alex."

PARKER: [sad]
"We tried to warn Reese, but..."

MORGAN:
"Point is, we're protective. Nothing personal."

INNER VOICE:
'Nothing personal.' While comparing you to the failure before you.

MORGAN:
"Alex never really got our dynamic. Always wanted
Reese to themselves. Super possessive."

[pause]

"You're not like that. Right?"
```

**Choice 6**:
1. "Definitely not. I'm not possessive at all." - Prove you're different

**Path D (Flip the script)**:
```
[Morgan's expression flickers]

MORGAN: [cold]
"Interesting question."

KAI: [quickly]
"Alex just had issues. Trust issues. Lots of therapy now, I hear."

PARKER:
"Reese was devastated. They really tried."

INNER VOICE:
The narrative is already written. Alex was crazy.
Wonder how they'll describe YOU to the next one.
```

---

#### Scene 8: Ellis Makes a Move
**Location**: restaurant
**Setup**: Triangulation attempt.

```
[Reese still hasn't returned. Ellis shifts closer.]

ELLIS: [seductive, low voice]
"You know, Reese talked about you for weeks before this.
They're really into you."

[hand on your arm]

"I can see why."

INNER VOICE:
Is this a compliment or a test?

ELLIS:
"Reese and I... we have history. But that's ancient.

You're the present."

[squeeze on arm]

"Lucky."
```

**Choice 7**:
1. "Thanks, I'm pretty into them too." - Neutral response
2. Move your arm away subtly - Boundary without drama (+10 AUTHENTICITY)

**Path D (Direct challenge)**:
```
[Ellis's smile freezes]

ELLIS: [cold flash, then recovered]
"Wow. Jealous type?"

[They lean back]

ELLIS: [neutral]
"I was just being friendly. Reese said you were cool."

[pause]

"Guess we'll see."

INNER VOICE:
You didn't play the game. They don't like that.
```

---

#### Scene 9: Avery's Opening
**Location**: restaurant
**Setup**: Potential ally makes contact.

```
[Later. You excuse yourself for the bathroom.
Avery follows shortly after.]

AVERY: [quiet, in hallway]
"Hey. You doing okay?"

[genuine concern]

AVERY:
"It's a lot, I know. When I first started dating Parker,
they did the same thing to me."

INNER VOICE:
Parker? Avery dates Parker. Interesting.

AVERY:
"Just... don't take it personally.
They're like this with everyone new."

[pause]

AVERY:
"They get better. Mostly."
```

**Choice 8**:
1. "Thanks. I appreciate you saying something." - Accept support (+15 AVERY_TRUST)
2. "Has it always been like this? The tests?" - Dig deeper (+10 THREAT_AWARENESS, +10 AVERY_TRUST)
3. "I can handle myself. But thanks." - Independent (+5 AUTHENTICITY, -5 AVERY_TRUST)

YOU:
"They're... a lot. But nice."

REESE:
"Yeah."

[pause]

REESE: [slight edge]
"Morgan said you asked a weird question about Alex."

INNER VOICE:
Morgan reported. Within HOURS.

REESE:
"What was that about?"
```

---

#### Scene 11: Jamie Reality Check
**Location**: text-screen
**Setup**: You text your outside friend.

```
[Phone screen]

YOU:
"Dinner with the friends. It was... intense."

JAMIE:
"Intense how?"

YOU:
"Questions about my job, my ex, my 'intentions.'
One of them is definitely going to report everything to Reese.
One was weirdly flirty. One flat-out said they're 'protective.'"

JAMIE:
"..."

JAMIE:
"Babe. That's not a friend group.
That's a security detail."

INNER VOICE:
When Jamie says it, it sounds so clear.

JAMIE:
"Do YOUR friends quiz Reese like that?"

[You realize the answer is no]
```

---

#### Scene 12: The Group Activity
**Location**: apartment → park (cabin weekend setup)
**Setup**: You're invited deeper. A whole weekend.

```
REESE: [excited]
"Okay so. Annual cabin trip is next month.
Everyone goes. It's kind of a big deal."

[watching your reaction]

REESE:
"You're invited. Obviously."

[pause]

REESE:
"Unless you don't want to come?"

INNER VOICE:
This is a test. 'No' is not really an option.

REESE:
"It would mean a lot to me. For you to really
bond with them. Away from everything."

[softer]

"Be part of my world."
```

**Choice 10**:
1. "I'd love to. Count me in." - Commit (+20 SOCIAL_STANDING, +15 REESE_APPROVAL)

```

Two hours from the city. No reliable cell service.
Five friends, one partner, and you.

[Everyone piles out of cars]

KAI: [excited]
"Same rooms as always?"

REESE: [to you]
"You're with me, obviously."

MORGAN: [neutral]
"[Your name], you're on grocery duty with me."

INNER VOICE:
Alone with Morgan. This should be interesting.
```

---

#### Scene 14: Morgan's Warning
**Location**: car (with Morgan, driving to store)

```
[Just you and Morgan. Radio off.]

MORGAN:
"So. Level with me."

[eyes on road]

"What do you actually want with Reese?"

YOU:
"I told you. I care about them—"

MORGAN:
"Everyone says that."

[pause]

MORGAN: [cold]
"But Reese is special. And this group protects its own."

[glances at you]

"Don't make us have to protect Reese from you."

INNER VOICE:
That's not a warning. That's a threat.
```

4. Stay silent - Let them wonder

---

#### Scene 15: The Drinking Game
**Location**: cabin
**Setup**: Night one. Games with stakes.

```
KAI:
"Never have I ever time!"

PARKER:
"Classic."

ELLIS: [smirking at you]
"Let's make it interesting. Secrets only."

NARRATION:
The questions start normal. Then get pointed.

KAI:
"Never have I ever... snooped through a partner's phone."

[Eyes drift to you]

MORGAN:
"Never have I ever... been jealous of my partner's friends."

[More eyes]

INNER VOICE:
This isn't a game. It's an interrogation with alcohol.
```

**Choice 12**:
1. Play along honestly - Whatever they're fishing for, you'll give it (-15 AUTHENTICITY, ammunition collected)
2. Lie your way through - Don't give them anything (+5 AUTHENTICITY, but risk if caught)

AVERY: [quiet, looking at stars]
"Can't sleep either?"

[You sit down]

AVERY:
"It gets better. After the first year."

[pause]

AVERY:
"Or you get better at pretending."

INNER VOICE:
There's something under that.

AVERY: [sad]
"I used to have my own friends. Before Parker.
Now it's just... the group."

[looks at you]

"Don't let that happen to you."

[FLAG: avery_confided]
```

---

#### Scene 17: The Loyalty Test
**Location**: cabin
**Setup**: Major choice point.

```
[Day two. You get a call. Jamie's in crisis - needs you.]

JAMIE: [phone, upset]
"I know you're at the cabin thing but I really need to talk.
Can you come back early? Please?"

[Reese is watching]

REESE: [cold undercurrent]
"Everything okay?"

YOU:
"Jamie needs me. Something happened."

REESE: [pause, then]
"We're in the middle of the weekend.
You'd really leave?"

[The group has gone quiet. Watching.]

MORGAN: [neutral]
"Sounds like Jamie needs to learn boundaries."

INNER VOICE:
The test. Your outside life vs. their world.
```

**Choice 13 - MAJOR**:
1. "You're right. Jamie can wait." - Choose the group (+30 SOCIAL_STANDING, +20 REESE_APPROVAL, -40 AUTHENTICITY, FLAG: chose_group_over_self)

### PART 3: THE RECKONING

#### Scene 18: The Aftermath (varies by cabin choices)

**If you left for Jamie:**
```
[You're back in the city. Phone blowing up.]

[Group chat you've been added to:]

KAI: "Can't believe they just left"
MORGAN: "Told you"
PARKER: "Reese is so upset"
ELLIS: "Yikes"

REESE: [text]
"We need to talk when I get back."

INNER VOICE:
You chose your friend. Now see what that costs.
```

**If you stayed:**
```
[Rest of weekend. Warmer reception. You're "in."]

MORGAN: [almost smiling]
"You're alright."

KAI: [hugging you]
"Family!"

[Reese beams]

INNER VOICE:
You passed. You're accepted.

[pause]

So why do you feel like you lost something?
```

---

#### Scene 19: The Pattern Revealed
**Location**: apartment
**Setup**: Reality crystallizes.

```
NARRATION:
Weeks pass. You're "in" the group now.

The tests continue. Subtler.
Which events you attend.
Who you prioritize.
What you say about Reese.

[Your phone shows: Jamie's texts getting shorter.
Your other friends fading.]

INNER VOICE:
Your world is shrinking.
Their world is expanding.

[Text from Kai:]
"Brunch Sunday? Group only obvs 💕"

[Text from college friend:]
"Hey stranger. You still alive?"

INNER VOICE:
You're being absorbed. Not invited - absorbed.
```

---

#### Scene 20: Confrontation Decision
**Location**: apartment

```
NARRATION:
You have a choice.

INNER VOICE:
You can confront Reese. About the group. The tests.
The way your life keeps shrinking while theirs expands.

Or you can talk to Avery. The one who might understand.

Or you can start pulling back. Slowly. See what happens.

Or you can commit. All the way in.
What's the big deal? They're Reese's friends.
Soon they'll be yours too.

Which version of yourself do you want to be?
```

**Choice 14 - MAJOR BRANCH**:
1. CONFRONT REESE: "We need to talk about your friends." → Branch A
2. ALLY WITH AVERY: Build an escape with the other outsider → Branch B
3. SLOW EXTRACTION: Start reclaiming outside relationships → Branch C
4. FULL ASSIMILATION: Commit to being part of the group → Branch D (bad ending path)

---

### BRANCH A: CONFRONT REESE

#### Scene A1: The Conversation

```
YOU:
"I need to talk about the group."

REESE: [neutral, guarded]
"Okay."

YOU:
"I feel like I'm being tested. Constantly.
And whenever I do something they don't like,
you hear about it before I get home."

REESE: [dismissive]
"They're just protective. You know that."

YOU:
"Protective of what? I'm not a threat.
Unless having my own friends is threatening?"

REESE: [cold flash]
"What's that supposed to mean?"

INNER VOICE:
You're in it now.
```

---

### BRANCH B: ALLY WITH AVERY

#### Scene B1: The Conspiracy

```
[Coffee with Avery. Away from the group.]

AVERY:
"I know what you're doing. Pulling back."

[pause]

AVERY:
"I tried that. Didn't work."

YOU:
"What happened?"

AVERY: [sad]
"Parker made me choose. The group or my friends.
I thought if I chose them, I'd eventually get
my old life back."

[shakes head]

"That was three years ago. I don't have an old life anymore."

INNER VOICE:
A warning. From someone who didn't get out.
```

---

## Endings

### GOOD ENDINGS

**1. Clean Break**
**Trigger**: AUTHENTICITY > 70, maintained_outside_identity, confronted pattern

```
YOU:
"I'm ending this. Not just us - the whole thing."

REESE:
"You can't just leave. The group—"

YOU:
"The group is the problem. You use them like
a surveillance system. A loyalty test factory."

[pause]

"I'm not interested in passing anymore."

NARRATION:
Six months later, Jamie asks about "the group."

YOU:
"Don't remember them."

[You do. But that's the point.]

INNER VOICE:
Some tests, the only way to win is to walk away.
```

---

**2. The Extraction**
**Trigger**: avery_confided, both successfully pulled back

```
NARRATION:
You and Avery. An unlikely alliance.

[Text from Avery, months later:]
"I did it. I'm out. Parker's furious but I'm OUT."

YOU:
"Proud of you."

AVERY:
"You first. Thanks for showing me it was possible."

INNER VOICE:
You got yourself out. And maybe saved someone else.

That's the best kind of victory.
```

---

**3. The Rebuild**
**Trigger**: AUTHENTICITY > 60, maintained_outside_identity, JAMIE connection intact

```
NARRATION:
Jamie's birthday. Your real friends around you.

JAMIE:
"Remember when you almost disappeared into that group?"

YOU:
"Almost. Key word."

JAMIE:
"What snapped you out of it?"

YOU:
"You. Texting me 'you still alive?'"

[pause]

"I was. Barely. Now I'm actually living."

INNER VOICE:
Outside relationships aren't threats.
They're lifelines.

Someone who loves you won't cut them.
```

---

### NEUTRAL ENDINGS

**4. The Negotiation**
**Trigger**: Confronted but stayed, some boundaries held

```
NARRATION:
You're still with Reese. Still in the group.
But on different terms.

YOU:
"I'm seeing my friends Saturday. Alone."

REESE: [tight]
"Fine."

[It's not fine. But it's happening.]

INNER VOICE:
Not a victory. Not a loss.
A holding pattern.

Better than full absorption.
For now.
```

---

**5. The Fade**
**Trigger**: Slow extraction, never confronted directly

```
NARRATION:
You drift. So gradually no one notices at first.

Less cabin trips. Fewer brunches.
Reese comments, but you're vague.

Eventually, you're "busy" more than you're there.

INNER VOICE:
You escaped through the back door.
Messy. Slow. But out.
```

---

### BAD ENDINGS

**6. The Absorption**
**Trigger**: chose_group_over_self, AUTHENTICITY < 30

```
NARRATION:
One year later. Group brunch.

KAI:
"Remember when you almost left for Jamie
that cabin weekend? Classic."

[Everyone laughs. You laugh too.]

MORGAN:
"You're one of us now."

[Reese squeezes your hand. You squeeze back.]

[Later. You try to remember Jamie's birthday.
You can't.]

INNER VOICE:
[This space is empty. Like your other life.]
```

---

**7. The Warning Becomes You**
**Trigger**: Full assimilation + new person joins group

```
NARRATION:
Reese has a new friend. Sam. They're bringing
them to dinner to meet everyone.

[Sam arrives, nervous, hopeful]

MORGAN: [to you]
"First impression?"

YOU: [automatically]
"We'll see. You know how it is."

[Morgan nods approvingly]

INNER VOICE:
[One line, distant:]
You've become the test.

NARRATION:
You watch Sam navigate the questions.
The inside jokes. The subtle evaluations.

You don't help them.

That's not what the group does.
```

---

**8. The Discard**
**Trigger**: Failed tests, SOCIAL_STANDING < 20, Reese turns

```
REESE: [cold]
"I talked to everyone. We've all agreed."

YOU:
"Agreed what?"

REESE:
"You're not a good fit. For the group. For me."

[pause]

REESE:
"This isn't working."

NARRATION:
Morgan was right. They protect their own.

You were never their own.
You were always the audition that failed.

INNER VOICE:
Cast out. By a group you never really joined.
The cruelest part? The relief under the hurt.
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Templates for Gendered Names
```typescript
characterTemplates: {
  reese: ['Reese', 'Quinn', 'Skyler', 'Jamie'], // Note: Jamie as partner requires renaming outside friend
  kai: ['Kai', 'Jordan', 'Riley', 'Sam'],
  morgan: ['Morgan', 'Taylor', 'Avery', 'Blake'],
  ellis: ['Ellis', 'Cameron', 'Shiloh', 'Drew'],
  parker: ['Parker', 'Finley', 'Hayden', 'Rowan'],
  avery: ['Avery', 'Jesse', 'Casey', 'Lane'],
  jamie: ['Jamie', 'Alex', 'Casey', 'Drew']
}
```

### Background Requirements
- apartment (getting ready, post-game, decision scenes)
- restaurant (the dinner)
- coffee-shop (Avery conversations, Jamie reality check)
- cabin (or apartment proxy) for weekend scenes
- text-screen (group chats, Jamie texts)
- car (Morgan scene)

### Group Chat Implementation
```typescript
// Use text-screen with multiple "speakers"
dialog: [
  { text: "GROUP CHAT - 'The Inner Circle'", speakerId: null },
  { text: "Kai: Can't believe they just left", speakerId: 'kai' },
  { text: "Morgan: Told you", speakerId: 'morgan' },
  // etc.
]
```

### Emotion Patterns for Group Members
```typescript
// Kai - Information gatherer
'warm_curious' → always friendly, always probing

// Morgan - Enforcer
'cold_evaluating' → default
'slightly_warm' → you passed a test

// Ellis - Triangulator
'seductive_testing' → flirty with purpose
'cold' → when you don't play jealous

// Parker - Validator
'happy_agreeing' → with Reese always
'nervous' → when group dynamics are called out

// Avery - Potential ally
'sad_knowing' → sees what you see
'hopeful' → when you connect
```
