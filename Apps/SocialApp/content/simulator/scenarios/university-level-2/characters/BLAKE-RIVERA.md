## The Competition Dynamic

### How It Manifests
- Takes credit for shared ideas
- "Lucky" framing for player's wins
- Subtle one-upmanship
- Slightly late with congratulations
- Works harder when player succeeds

### Teaching Function
Even good friends can have competitive edges. Recognizing this doesn't mean ending friendship - it means managing it.

### Red Flags to Watch
1. Backhanded compliments
2. "I was going to suggest that" after your idea works
3. More enthusiastic about your failures than successes
4. Compares himself favorably in subtle ways
