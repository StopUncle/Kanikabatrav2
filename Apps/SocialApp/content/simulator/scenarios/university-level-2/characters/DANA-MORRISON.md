## Clinical Profile

### DSM-5 Markers (NPD Covert)
- Same core narcissism but expressed through VICTIMHOOD
- Hypersensitive to criticism (even more than grandiose)
- Passive-aggressive rather than overtly aggressive
- Plays martyr to get sympathy/attention
- Uses indirect methods to assert control
- Sweet-faced, patient, vindictive

### Key Difference from Grandiose NPD
Grandiose says: "I'm better than you" (loud)
Covert says: "I'm worse off than everyone" (to get same supply through pity)

Both have same fragile ego, same need for supply, same lack of empathy.

### Core Method
**Sabotage through helpfulness** - Every "kind" act has a hidden cost. Every favor creates an invisible debt.

## Character Arc

### Level 2 Arc
1. **Introduction**: The sweetest person you'll meet

- Shows manipulation through kindness
- Teaches that not all threats look threatening
- Plausible deniability master

## Dialogue Analysis

### Voice Patterns

#### Sweet Mode (Default Mask)
```
"Oh, let me help with that!"
"I don't want anything. I just like helping."
"You're so talented. I wish I could do that."
"I'm just happy when my friends are happy."
```
- Relentlessly positive
- Self-deprecating to appear humble
- Always offering assistance
- Creates dependency through "kindness"

#### Victim Mode (When Challenged)
```
"I don't know why these things always happen to ME."
"I try so hard, but no one ever notices."
"After everything I've sacrificed..."
"I guess I'm just not important to anyone."
```
- Instant martyr pivot
- Weaponized sadness
- Guilt-tripping without direct accusation
- Makes challenger feel like bully

#### Passive-Aggressive Mode
```
"No, go ahead. I'll be fine here. Alone."
"I just think it's interesting that..."
"I'm not saying anything, I'm just saying."
"It's fine. Really. I'm used to it."
```
- Indirect communication
- Loaded silences
- "Fine" that clearly isn't
- Punishing without confronting

#### When Caught (DARVO-lite)
```
"I can't believe you'd think that of me."
"You're the one who drove me to this."
"This is just like you to make this about you."
"I was only trying to help."
```
- Never admits wrongdoing
- Deflects to how hurt SHE is
- Blames circumstances, others, player
- Tears appear on cue

## Sabotage Methods

### How She Operates
1. **Offers help** → Creates dependency
2. **Gathers information** → "Just checking in on you"
3. **Subtle undermining** → "I heard what they said about you..."
4. **Opportunity blocking** → "Oh, I didn't think you'd want to go"
5. **Smear campaign** → "I'm worried about them..."

### Plausible Deniability
Every sabotage has a "reasonable" explanation:
- "I forgot to mention it"
- "I thought I was helping"
- "I was protecting you"
- "They must have misunderstood"

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Wounded expressions | Manipulation through sympathy |
| Downcast eyes (watching) | Gauging your reaction |
| Heavy sighs | Passive-aggressive punishment |
| "Hurt" posture | Performance, not feeling |
| Tears on cue | Weapon, not emotion |
| Overly helpful | Creating debt/dependency |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Too sweet** = mask hiding agenda
2. **Constant self-deprecation** = fishing for reassurance
3. **"I'm just worried about you"** = gathering intel
4. **Never directly confronts** = passive-aggressive style
5. **Always the victim** = DARVO in action
6. **Sabotage through helpfulness** = covert control

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Level 2 | Sweet helper / hidden saboteur | INTRODUCED |
| Level 3 | Evolved antagonist (sweetness gone) | Sharp, cold, patient |
| Level 4 | Full antagonist OR managed threat | Depending on L2-3 choices |

### Evolution Note
By Level 3, if player has seen through her, the sweetness drops:
> "The sweetness is gone. What's left is sharp, cold, and patient. She's been waiting for this."

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Always** maintain plausible deniability
- **Never** directly aggressive or mean
- Sabotage disguised as help
- Victim pivot when challenged
- Tears as tactical weapon
- Indirect communication (sighs, silences)
- Long game player (patient, vindictive)
- Evolution across levels (mask erodes)
