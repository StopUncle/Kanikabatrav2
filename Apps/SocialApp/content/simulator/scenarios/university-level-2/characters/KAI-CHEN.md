## Clinical Profile

- Splitting: black-and-white thinking (idealize OR devalue)
- Impulsive behaviors
- Unstable self-image
- "Favorite Person" dependency
- Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment

### The Idealization-Devaluation Cycle

**Idealization Phase:**
- Target is PERFECT, can do no wrong
- Intense attachment forms quickly
- "You're the only one who understands me"
- Overwhelming attention and affection

**Devaluation Phase:**
- Triggered by perceived flaw, conflict, or abandonment threat
- Target becomes ALL bad
- "You're just like everyone else"
- Intense anger, withdrawal, or attempts to hurt

**The cycle repeats.** Small triggers can flip the switch.

## BPD Volatility (AUTHENTICITY ADDITION)

### Level 3 Climax Scene Updates
When approaching player about Victoria's move:

**OLD (Wrong):** Too controlled and rational
```
"Victoria is making a move. Tonight." (calm)
"That's why I found you." (logical)
```

**NEW (Correct):** Volatility markers present
```
"Don't leave. Don't you DARE leave yet." Grip shaking. Eyes too bright.
"I don't have TIME to slow down!" Catches herself. "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
"You're the only one I can trust." Relief, suspicion, relief again.
```

**Volatility markers:**
- Intensity spikes
- Fear of abandonment language
- Rapid emotional shifts
- Push-pull in same conversation
- Self-correction mid-sentence

---

## Level 4 Abandonment Trigger

### Scene: Kai Learns Player Aligned with Millicent

```
"I sponsored you. I believed in you. Don't you DARE leave me for HER."
"After everything I did for you..."
"You're just like everyone else. Using me. Climbing."
```

**Behavioral markers:**
- Panic and rage fused together
- Devaluation attempt
- Rewrites entire relationship
- "After everything" framing

| Eyes too bright | Emotional flooding |
| Rapid speech | Anxiety-driven |
| Goes still suddenly | Split occurring |

| Consistent validation | Stabilizes temporarily |
| Clear communication | Reduces anxiety |
| Sudden distance | Triggers panic |
| Align with others | Abandonment trigger |
| Stay through storm | Builds trust (slowly) |
| Set boundaries gently | Best approach |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Intense immediate connection** = idealization phase
2. **"You're the only one"** = favorite person dependency
3. **Complete reversals** = splitting
4. **"Promise you won't leave"** = abandonment fear
5. **Contradictory demands** = push-pull pattern
6. **Rewrites history when hurt** = devaluation active

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Intensity | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| Level 2 | Introduction, connection | Medium | INTRODUCED |
| Level 3 | Sponsor, invested, volatile | HIGH | Loyalty tested |
| Level 4 | Crisis, abandonment trigger | MAXIMUM | Resolution needed |

---

## Relationship to Casey Chen

Kai is Casey's cousin. This creates:
- Family dynamic tension
- Potential information bridge
- Loyalty conflicts
- Different attachment styles (anxious vs borderline)

---

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Intensity** is the signature
- Rapid emotional shifts (sometimes mid-sentence)
- Self-aware moments followed by repetition
- Fear of abandonment underlies everything
- Can be genuinely warm and loyal
- But volatility is real, not performed
- Push-pull confuses player (intentionally)
- Stakes become personal (sponsor role)
