## Clinical Profile

### Attachment Style Markers (Dismissive-Avoidant)
- Avoids intimacy, withdraws when closeness increases
- Self-reliant to the point of isolation
- Dismisses emotional needs (own and others')
- Comfortable alone, uncomfortable with dependency
- High self-esteem (or appears so)
- Pushes away then may pull back
- Creates chaos through non-commitment

### Core Pattern
**Push-Pull Cycle**: Engages when distance is safe, withdraws when intimacy threatens.

### Core Wound (Hidden)
Deep fear of dependency, likely from early experiences of needs not being met. Learned that needing others = vulnerability = pain.

## Dialogue Analysis

### Voice Patterns

#### Distant Mode (Default)
```
"I need some space."
"You're being clingy."
"I don't see what the big deal is."
"I'm fine. I don't need to talk about it."
```
- Minimizes emotional content
- Labels others as "too much"
- Self-sufficient framing
- Shuts down intimacy attempts

#### Charming Mode (When Distance is Safe)
```
"I've missed this."
"You always got me, you know?"
"Maybe we should hang out sometime."
```
- Re-engages when pressure is off
- Nostalgic, creates longing
- Never commits to anything concrete
- Creates hope, then withdraws again

#### Dismissive Mode (When Pursued)
```
"Why are you making this a thing?"
"This is moving too fast."
"I never said it was serious."
"I think you're reading into this."
```
- Gaslighting undertones
- Makes pursuer feel "crazy"
- Retreats into silence
- Labels emotional needs as problems

#### Cold Mode (Final Withdrawal)
```
"I think we want different things."
"Maybe this isn't working."
[Silence, emotional unavailability]
```
- Ends without real explanation
- Leaves door slightly open
- Creates unfinished feeling
- May return later when safe again

## The Push-Pull Cycle

### How It Works
1. **Interest Phase**: Shows attention, creates hope
2. **Intimacy Threat**: Partner gets closer
3. **Withdrawal**: Goes cold, creates distance
4. **Partner Pursues**: Labeled as "clingy"
5. **Partner Gives Up**: Marcus re-engages
6. **Cycle Repeats**

### Teaching Function
Shows how withdrawal creates pursuit, and pursuit creates withdrawal.

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Checks phone during conversation | Creating emotional distance |
| Late or cancels plans | Testing commitment/control |
| Charming to others, cold to partner | Public vs private face |
| "I need space" | Intimacy overwhelming |
| Returns after disappearing | Distance made safety |
| Never confirms plans firmly | Keeps options open |

---

## How to Handle Marcus

| Approach | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Pursue harder | Withdraws more |
| Give space | May re-engage |
| Match energy | Creates standoff |
| Move on visibly | Triggers re-pursuit |
| Name the pattern | May flee permanently |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Hot-cold cycles** = avoidant attachment
2. **"You're being clingy"** = projection of their fear
3. **Never confirms plans** = commitment avoidance
4. **Returns after withdrawal** = not changed, just reset
5. **Charming to others, cold to you** = public/private split
6. **Makes you feel crazy** = gaslighting through avoidance

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Level 2 | Ex everyone wants, creates chaos | INTRODUCED |
| Level 3 | Wild card, on someone's arm | Unpredictable |
| Level 4 | Reappears with agenda | Charming, non-committal |

### Evolution Note
> "The dismissive avoidant who pushes everyone away... until they might be useful."

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Never** emotionally available for long
- Charming at distance, cold up close
- Withdraws when intimacy increases
- Labels pursuit as "clingy"
- Never explains disappearances
- May gaslight subtly
- Creates longing through absence
- The mystery IS the appeal (and the trap)
