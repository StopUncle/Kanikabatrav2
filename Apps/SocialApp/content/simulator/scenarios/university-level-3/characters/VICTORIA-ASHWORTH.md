## Dialogue Analysis

### Voice Patterns

#### Grandiose Mode (Default)
```
"People like us don't have to explain ourselves."
"I've forgotten more about [X] than you'll ever know."
"When you've achieved what I have, then we can talk."
"Do you have any idea who you're speaking to?"
```
- Statements of superiority
- Dismissive of others' credentials
- "We" includes only select few
- Assumes deference

#### Territorial Mode
```
"This is my space. You're a guest here."
"I've seen your type before. Ambitious. Hungry."
"Know your place, and we'll get along fine."
"Maris thinks she found something. We'll see."
```
- Marking boundaries
- Warning undertones
- Condescending assessment
- Positioning above Maris

#### Wounded Mode (Narcissistic Injury)
```
"How DARE you."
"Do you have any idea how insulting that is?"
"After everything I've built..."
"You'll regret this."
```
- Rage at perceived slights
- Injury is existential
- Disproportionate response
- Revenge promised

## DARVO Response Pattern (AUTHENTICITY ADDITION)

### When Caught or Exposed

**CRITICAL:** Victoria NEVER accepts being caught. She uses DARVO automatically:

**D - Deny:**
```
"That's not what happened. You're twisting things."
"I never said that. You must have misheard."
"That's a complete fabrication."
```

**A - Attack:**
```
"The fact that you'd even accuse me says more about YOU."
"What's your agenda here? Who sent you?"
"You're clearly threatened by me."
```

**RVO - Reverse Victim and Offender:**
```
"Do you have any idea how hurtful it is that you'd think that of me?"
"I'm the one being attacked here."
"After everything I've done, this is what I get."
```

### Physical Tells During DARVO
- Nostril flare
- Jaw tightens
- Eyes narrow then widen (performative surprise)
- Steps backward (distancing) OR invades space (dominant)
- Voice rises then controlled drop

---

## Defensive Rage Pattern (AUTHENTICITY ADDITION)

### When Player Gives Pragmatic Response

**OLD (Wrong):**
> Response: "I want to be on the winning side."
> Reaction: "A real laugh. Now THAT I can work with."

**NEW (Correct):** She FIRST must feel threatened, then defended:

1. **Initial coldness:** "You think there's a question of sides?"
2. **Defensive position:** "MY side doesn't need proving."
3. **Test loyalty TO HER:** "Tell me why I should even let you near my side."
4. **Only warm up AFTER** player validates her superiority

### Teaching
NPD requires validation FIRST, then can engage. Skipping to pragmatics is insulting.

## The Victoria-Millicent History

### Background
- Victoria's first husband died (suicide)
- She blames Millicent Caldwell
- Twenty years of hatred
- "Everyone important knows. Nobody talks."

### The Suicide
- Details cost extra (per Elena)
- Shaped every alliance in this world
- Victoria sees herself as victim
- Truth may be more complex

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Looks you up and down | Assessment/dismissal |
| "Darling" with ice | Condescension |
| References "my people" | Marking hierarchy |
| Mentions husband casually | Territorial claim |
| Goes still after slight | Injury processing |
| Sweet dismissal | You're beneath anger |

---

## How to Handle Victoria

| Tactic | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Ego inflation | Opens doors (temporarily) |
| Direct challenge | Nuclear response |
| Playing dumb | She dismisses you (safer) |
| Ask "advice" | Makes her feel superior |
| Imply rivalry threat | Dangerous |
| Validate superiority | Required first step |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Needs validation before engagement** = fragile ego
2. **Disproportionate response to slights** = narcissistic injury
3. **DARVO when caught** = automatic deflection
4. **"Do you know who I am"** = status-dependent identity
5. **Ancient grudges** = never forgives, never forgets
6. **Sweet dismissal** = you're not worth anger

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Intensity |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Level 3 | Power player, territorial | HIGH |
| Level 4 | Faction leader, father appears | MAXIMUM |

---

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Always** assumes superiority
- **Never** accepts criticism without DARVO
- Validation required before pragmatics
- Sweet condescension > overt hostility
- Ancient grudges flavor everything
- Status is identity
- Injury is existential, not just annoying
- Revenge is patient (like Maris, but louder)
