## Clinical Profile

### DSM-5 Markers (ASPD Factor 2)

- Charm is inconsistent
- Needs immediate gratification
- Burns bridges impulsively (sometimes)
- Higher emotional volatility than Factor 1
- Associated with risk-taking

### Key Difference from Factor 1 (Harrison/Maris)
Factor 2 is the "hot" antisocial - they feel things, they just don't care about consequences. Factor 1 is the "cold" antisocial - reduced emotional response entirely.

Elena FEELS irritation, impatience, desire. She just doesn't care about your feelings or social rules.

## Dialogue Analysis

### Voice Patterns

#### Seductive Mode (Default)
```
"You're quite popular tonight."
"I've been watching your performance."
"Let's trade."
```
- Draws you in with interest
- Implies she has what you want
- Creates intrigue
- Seduction as tactic, not connection

#### Transactional Mode (Core)
```
"Information is currency here. The only real one."
"That wasn't free. You owe me now."
"What's in it for me?"
"Show me the value first."
```
- NOTHING is free
- Every exchange is tracked
- Quid pro quo always
- Ledger mentality

#### Knowing Mode
```
"Tyler attracts attention. I process it."
"I know where the bodies are buried. I helped dig some of the graves."
"Everyone has secrets. Even you."
```
- Demonstrates knowledge as power
- Implies danger through information
- Amoral about content
- No judgment, just data

#### Impatient Mode
```
"False modesty. Boring."
"I don't have time for this."
"You just wasted my time. That's a debt, not a favor."
```
- Loses patience quickly
- Immediate gratification need
- Values efficiency
- Underselling yourself = insult

## Transactional Nature (AUTHENTICITY ADDITION)

### CRITICAL: Every Interaction Has a Price

**OLD (Problem):** Elena sometimes gave information freely or out of kindness.

**NEW (Correct):** NOTHING is free. Ever.

**Even "free" samples:**
```
"Victoria and Millicent Caldwell were friends once. Close friends."
"What happened?"
"That wasn't free." She tilts her head. "But I'll give you more. Something involving a man. A betrayal. The details cost extra."
```

**When player offers good trade:**
```
"Now we're talking. Sit."
"We're even now. For this exchange. The next one starts fresh."
```

**Teaching:** Information has explicit value. Kindness is currency spent, not given.

### The Ledger Mentality
- Remembers every debt
- Every favor is tracked
- "Free" doesn't exist
- Generosity is investment, expecting return

---

## The Tyler-Elena Dynamic

### Information System
- Tyler is the FRONT (attracts attention, collects gossip)
- Elena is the BACKEND (processes, catalogs, trades)
- Together they know everything
- Tyler doesn't realize how much Elena uses him

### Player Insight
```
Player: "You're the one who actually runs the information network. Tyler's the front."
Elena: Something flickers in her eyes. "Interesting. That observation just bought you something."
```

---

## Key Information Elena Holds

### Victoria-Millicent History
- Victoria's first husband died (suicide)
- Victoria blames Millicent
- Twenty years of hatred shaped everything
- Full story is "premium tier" intel

### Harrison's Agenda
- Positioning against Victoria for two years
- Quietly, methodically
- Reasons are valuable intel

### Everyone's Secrets
- Knows things about every major player
- Trades in private information
- "Where bodies are buried" isn't metaphor

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Leans in | Drawing you into trade |
| Knowing smile | Has information on you |

| Impatient gesture | Running out of patience |
| Vanishes suddenly | Transaction complete |

## How to Trade with Elena

| Ask "what do I get" | Respects the game |
| Expect free info | Insulting |
| Strategic trade | Perfect exchange |
| False modesty | Wastes her time (bad) |
| Specific ask | Efficient (good) |

### Optimal Trade Pattern
```
Player: "I'll tell you what Victoria said about the Caldwells. You tell me why."
Elena: A real smile. "Now we're talking. Sit."
```

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Everything is transactional** = no genuine generosity
2. **Seduction is tactic** = connection isn't the goal
3. **Impatient with time-wasters** = efficiency valued
4. **Knows everyone's secrets** = dangerous to cross
5. **"Samples" still cost** = nothing is free
6. **Ledger mentality** = debts remembered

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Stakes |
|-------|------|--------|
| Level 3 | Information broker, trades intel | Medium |
| Level 4 | Higher stakes, everything has price | High |

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Always** transactional (NEVER free information)
- Seductive but not for connection
- Impatient with inefficiency
- Values direct communication
- Knows more than she says
- Ledger of favors/debts
- Factor 2 = can be impatient/irritable
- Tyler is her front (doesn't know it)
- Information IS her currency
