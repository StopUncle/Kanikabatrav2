3. Family dynamics can split two identical people
4. Warning signs can come from unexpected allies

- Warmth vs Maris's calculated charm
- Genuine concern vs strategic vulnerability
- Real help vs transactional favor
- Grief for loss vs exploitation of weakness

|----------|---------|
| Trust her | She delivers (rare) |
| Suspect agenda | She understands (patient) |
| Ask about Maris | Careful truth |
| Push about Victoria | Painful territory |

---

## Red Flags Taught (Inverse)

Millicent teaches by CONTRAST - what genuine looks like:

1. **Warmth that persists** = not performance
2. **Help without conditions** = rare but real
3. **Same genetics, different outcome** = nature AND nurture
4. **Warnings without agenda** = genuine concern
5. **Grief for family** = love despite knowing

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Complexity |
|-------|------|------------|
| Level 3 | Warm introduction, warnings | Simple ally |
| Level 4 | Reveals family truths, Victoria conflict | Complex |

### Level 4 Complication
- Kai may see player's alliance with Millicent as abandonment
- Creates conflict: ally choice between Kai (sponsor) and Millicent (insight)
- "I sponsored you. I believed in you. Don't you dare leave me for HER."
