## Clinical Profile

### DSM-5 Markers (ASPD Factor 1 - Primary Psychopath)
- Calculated, patient, strategic
- Appears calm under pressure
- Charm is a TOOL, not impulsive
- Doesn't need to "win" every interaction
- Can appear to lose strategically
- Always calculating ROI on every interaction
- Reduced autonomic stress response (genuinely calm, not faking)

### Key Difference from Maris
Harrison is the **patient** psychopath. Where Maris creates chaos and observes, Harrison builds systems and controls access. He rarely speaks, but when he does, everyone listens.

```
"Interesting."
"You've made quite an impression tonight."
"Both Caldwells in one evening. That's usually a career-ending experience."
```
- Minimal words, maximum impact
- Observational statements
- Never asks what he could observe
- Implies he knows more than he says

#### Cryptic Mode
```
"Character is the only thing that compounds."
"I collect talent. Not for myself. For the ecosystem."
"I pay attention. It's why I'm still here."
```
- Philosophical undertones
- Never fully explains
- Leaves you wanting more
- Implies vast knowledge

#### Direct Mode (Rare)
```
"Thursday. Eight PM. Don't be late."
"Victoria will not be invited. For reasons that will become clear."

- Information is power (gives sparingly)
- Corrections are lessons

## Casual Cruelty Moment (AUTHENTICITY ADDITION)

### The Spilled Wine Scene

During conversation with player, a waiter stumbles nearby. Red wine cascades down a guest's white dress. The woman gasps, humiliated.

**Harrison's Response:**
```
Harrison watches. His expression doesn't change.

"Fascinating how quickly dignity evaporates."

He takes a sip of his drink.

"She'll never recover socially. That waiter just ended a career she spent decades building."
```

**Inner Voice:** *No concern. No sympathy. Just... observation. Like watching insects.*

### Teaching Function
Shows psychopathic indifference isn't strategic - it's fundamental. He observes human suffering the way you'd watch weather.

---

## Power Network Positioning

- Controls who enters highest tiers
- Victoria is rival faction (he's positioning against her)
- Elena feeds him information
- Everyone answers to someone

- Quietly, methodically
- Reasons unknown to most
- Player might be a piece in his game

## Optimal Interaction Patterns

### What Works
```
Player: "The Caldwells were tests. You're the offer. What's the proposition?"
Harrison: His eyes sharpen. Real interest. "You see the board, not just the pieces."
```

### What Doesn't Work
```
Player: "I'm just trying to make connections."
Harrison: "Connections." He sounds bored. "Everyone makes connections. Few make impact."
```

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Genuine calm under all circumstances** = reduced emotional response
2. **Minimal words, maximum impact** = everything calculated
3. **Observes suffering without reaction** = fundamental indifference
4. **Controls access quietly** = patient power
5. **Never explains disappearances** = you're not entitled to reasons
6. **Tests without announcing** = always evaluating

---

## Cross-Level Arc

| Level | Role | Visibility |
|-------|------|------------|
| Level 3 | Power broker, invites to next tier | Introduced (mysterious) |
| Level 4 | The Architect, evaluates directly | Central (revealed) |

---

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Economy** of words (less is more)
- **Never** shows genuine emotion
- Appears and disappears with purpose
- Every interaction is evaluation
- Calm is genuine, not performance
- Casual cruelty reveals true nature
- Patient player of long games
- Above Maris in hierarchy
- The mystery IS the power
