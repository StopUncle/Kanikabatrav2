## Dialogue Analysis

### Total Lines
- **~10 spoken dialogue lines** in Party Path
- Deep psychological content in limited space

### Voice Patterns

#### Apologetic Mode (Default)
```
"Here's your martini. Extra olives, like you said."
"I—I'm sorry. I can get another—"
```
- Voice almost apologetic
- Tries not to take up space
- Quick to accept blame
- Eager to fix "mistakes"

#### Defensive/Rationalizing Mode
```
"Oh, that? She didn't mean it."
"She just has high standards."
"I'm good at it. And she's busy with... everything else. It makes sense."
```
- Normalizes abuse
- Makes excuses for Maris
- Logic-based defense of servitude
- Genuine belief (or made himself believe)

#### Genuine Obliviousness Mode (AUTHENTICITY FIX)

**OLD (Wrong):** Caleb had self-aware lines like "I know that now" and analyzed his dysfunction like a therapy patient.

**NEW (Correct):** Dependent personalities DON'T have this insight:
```
"She needs me. That's enough."
"I don't understand the question."
"Why would I want to leave? She needs someone to help her."
"I'm good at this. It makes sense."
```

When player suggests alternatives or points out abuse:
```
"Abuse? That's a strong word. She just has high standards."
"I'm not sure what you mean."
"This works for us. Why would I change it?"
```

**Key insight:** Caleb genuinely DOESN'T see it as abuse:
- Rationalizes as "how relationships work"
- Shows zero curiosity about alternatives
- Can't articulate why he stays (because he doesn't question it)
- Confusion when player suggests leaving

**Teaching:** The absence of self-awareness IS the pathology. He's not hiding insight - he genuinely lacks it.

#### Dismissive Mode (Wall Up)
```
"You sound like my therapist. Before I stopped going."
"I should get this to her. Nice talking to you."
"She needs me. I need her."
```
- Retreats when challenged
- References abandoned help
- Returns to servitude as comfort
- Can't be saved against his will

### Key Dialogue Moments

#### The Humiliation (party-caleb-observation)
Maris: "It's cute how hard he tries. He does my homework too. Isn't that sweet?"
*The group laughs. Caleb laughs too.*

Teaching: He laughed at his own humiliation. That's what conditioning looks like.

#### The Trade (party-caleb-dialogue)
> "Do you know what it's like to be invisible? To not matter to anyone? She sees me. Every day."

Teaching: Being seen through abuse > not being seen at all (to him).

#### The Non-Choice (party-caleb-dialogue) - AUTHENTICITY FIX
> "Leave? Why would I leave? She needs me."
> "I don't understand. This is just... how it works."
> [Player: "But she treats you terribly."]
> "Does she?" Genuine confusion. "I think you're misreading the situation."

Teaching: He doesn't CHOOSE the cage. He doesn't SEE it as a cage.

#### The Touch (party-caleb-warning)
*Maris's hand brushes his—probably accidental. He lights up.*

Teaching: Crumbs feel like feasts to the starving.

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Moves like trying not to take space | Minimizing self |
| Flinches when she speaks sharply | Conditioned response |
| Smiles after she insults him | Rationalizing abuse as attention |
| "She's not that bad when you know her" | Stockholm syndrome |
| Nervously checks if she's watching | Existence validated by her gaze |
| Lights up at any touch | Starved for positive contact |
| Laughs at own humiliation | Conditioning complete |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Smiles after abuse** = normalized mistreatment
2. **"She doesn't mean it"** = rationalization defense
3. **Fears being alone more than being hurt** = dependency trap
4. **Does homework/errands** = servitude disguised as helpfulness
5. **Content in submission** = broken acceptance
6. **Stopped therapy** = resisting help

---

## Relationship Tracking

### Score Range
Not tracked (minor character).

### Information Source Potential
- Knows EVERYTHING about Maris
- Won't volunteer information
- Might share if player shows genuine care
- Could become future ally with extensive investment

---

## The Inner Voice Commentary

> "He laughed. Why did he laugh?"
> "That's what supply looks like. Someone so starved for connection they'll accept crumbs and call it a feast."
> "You could become that. If you're not careful."

### Teaching Function
Caleb exists to show the player:
1. What happens if you fall into Maris's orbit
2. What "supply" looks like from outside
3. The end-state of dependency
4. That some people can't be saved

---

## Origin Story (Revealed in Dialogue) - AUTHENTICITY FIX

> "Freshman orientation. She was lost. I helped her find her dorm."
> "We've been friends ever since."

**OLD (Wrong):** "She wasn't really lost. I know that now." - Too self-aware.

**NEW (Correct):** He still believes she was genuinely lost. He has NO insight into the manipulation.

> Player: "Do you think she might have been testing you?"
> Caleb: "Testing? No. She was just lost. Why would she test someone?"

Teaching: He STILL doesn't see the manipulation. Years later. That's the horror.

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Apologetic** - every statement hedged
- **Self-diminishing** - minimizes own worth
- **Rationalizing** - logic for illogical choices
- **Brief awareness** - flashes of truth, then retreat
- **Never** self-advocacy or anger at Maris
- **Peaceful acceptance** - disturbing contentment
- When challenged, wall goes up
- Returns to Maris like coming home
