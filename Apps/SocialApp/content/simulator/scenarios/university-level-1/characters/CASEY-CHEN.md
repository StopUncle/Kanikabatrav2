## Dialogue Analysis

### Total Lines
- **~50+ spoken dialogue lines** across Study Path
- Primary NPC with most emotional depth

### Voice Patterns

#### Default Mode (Hedged, Uncertain)
```
"I'm Casey. I don't think we've met?" (statement as question)
"I like to stay ahead. Is that weird?"
"I think... Maybe I'm wrong, but..."
"This might be stupid..."
```
- Constant qualifiers
- Self-deprecating
- Seeks validation in every statement
- Afraid of being judged

#### Opening Up (Vulnerable)
```
"My mom wanted me to go to a school closer to home. She's... a lot."
"I thought college would be different. But I'm still just... invisible."
"The people who notice me want something."
"Do you know what it's like to be invisible? To not matter to anyone?"
```
- Shares then panics
- Tests if you're different
- References past pain
- Voice of someone who's been burned

#### Testing Mode (Guarded)
```
"Who told you that?" (about gala job)
"You know, people only ever talk to me when they want something."
"Everyone knows I have access to spare tickets. It's why they're nice to me."
"I was going to work up to it."
```
- Watching for agenda
- Referencing past users
- Creating opportunities for player to prove themselves

#### Hurt Mode (Withdrawn)
```
"You know what's actually sad? People like you."
"I actually thought you were different."
"Wow. Okay."
"Thanks for the conversation. It was... nice. For a while."
```
- Goes cold, not angry
- Silence worse than yelling
- Withdraws rather than fights
- Self-protective retreat

#### Hopeful Mode (Rare)
```
"You're the first person who's actually asked me about my classes."
"This is... nice."
"I'll hold you to that."
"Wait, really?" (when player chooses her)
```
- Surprised by genuine interest
- Small smiles break through
- Vulnerability without armor
- Real connection moments

#### Idealization Mode (NEW - When Player Stays After Twist)
**AUTHENTICITY FIX:** After confession, Casey shouldn't be measured and rational.

When player STAYS despite having no utility, anxious-attached shows EXPLOSIVE idealization:
```
"You stayed. You actually stayed."
"I can't believe you're real."
"No one's ever... I mean... you didn't have to..."
"You're not like them. You're actually not like them."
```

**Behavioral markers:**
- Eyes go wet with relief
- Physical proximity increases (leans in, touches arm)
- Rapid attachment forms
- Player becomes "savior figure" in her mind
- Fear of losing this connection intensifies IMMEDIATELY

**Teaching:** The intensity of anxious attachment AFTER acceptance is as telling as the testing before.

### Key Dialogue Moments

#### The Test (study-defensive)
> "You know, people only ever talk to me when they want something. Usually it's the gala thing."

Teaching: Anxious types test before trusting.

#### The Confession (study-the-confession) - AUTHENTICITY FIX

**OLD (Wrong):** Casey confesses unprompted, jumping straight to admission.

**NEW (Correct):** Anxious-attached people hide shame. Confession only happens when:
1. Player discovers discrepancy or presses
2. Casey DENIES initially: "What do you mean? I—I still have access..."
3. Only confesses when cornered: "Okay. Okay. Just... please don't leave."
4. Shows **panic**, not calm admission

```
"What? No, I... I can get you in. I just need to..."
"Please. Please don't be mad. I was going to fix it."
"I didn't mean to lie. I just... you were actually TALKING to me."
```

Teaching: Anxious types extend false narratives to delay rejection.

#### The Explanation (study-the-lie)
> "Do you know what it's like? Being invisible. Then suddenly everyone wants to be your friend because of what you can DO for them."
> "So I kept letting people think. Because at least they still SAT with me. Even if it was fake."

Teaching: Loneliness drives deception. Compassion matters.

#### The Offer (study-her-offer)
> "The gala is going to be miserable. I'll be stuck at the door while everyone else networks. But if you came, at least I'd have someone to complain to."

Teaching: She's not offering a ticket. She's offering company.

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Eyes go wet briefly | Touched a real wound |
| Retreats into books | Defense mechanism activated |
| "Is that weird?" | Seeking validation |
| "People only talk to me when..." | Testing if you're different |
| Shares deeply then panics | Afraid of vulnerability being used |
| Statement as question | Uncertain, needs reassurance |
| Movements become sharp | Wall going up |
| Bag half-zipped, hesitating | Wants you to stop her |

---

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Constant qualifiers** = fear of judgment
2. **Quick to offer value** = seeking acceptance through usefulness
3. **"People only want..."** = testing if you're different
4. **Overpromising connections** = loneliness-driven deception
5. **Apologizing for existing** = deep-seated invisibility wound

## Relationship Tracking

### Score Range
`-100 to +100`

| Score | Status |
|-------|--------|
| < -50 | Betrayed (will become antagonist) |
| -50 to 0 | Guarded (walls up) |
| 0 to 50 | Testing (evaluating intentions) |
| 50 to 75 | Opening (beginning to trust) |
| > 75 | Bonded (genuine connection) |

### What She Wants
- Genuine connection (not transactional)
- To be seen as a person, not a ticket source
- Someone who stays when she can't deliver
- Validation of her worth beyond usefulness

---

## Claim Tracking (Lie Detection)

Casey tracks player claims and notices contradictions:

| Claim | Context |
|-------|---------|
| `just-looking-for-quiet` | Player said no agenda |
| `no-ticket-interest` | Player claimed not after tickets |
| `here-for-fresh-start` | Player shared motivation |
| `gala-not-main-reason` | Acknowledged gala but other interest |
| `not-pursuing-tickets` | Deliberately ignored gala opportunity |

**Contradicting claims triggers defensive walls.**

- **Never** confident assertions or demands
- Vulnerability followed by panic/retreat
- Tests before trusting
- Self-deprecating humor as defense
- Surprised by genuine interest
- Silence/cold > anger when hurt
- Eyes reveal what words hide
