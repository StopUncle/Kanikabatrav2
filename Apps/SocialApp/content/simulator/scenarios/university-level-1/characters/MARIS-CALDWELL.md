## Dialogue Analysis

### Total Lines
- **~45+ spoken dialogue lines** across Party Path
- **Referenced** in Setup, Study Path, and Secret Path

### Voice Patterns

#### Charm Mode (Default)
```
"Hi. I'm Maris. I don't think we've met, which means you're either new or very good at hiding."
"I like you already."
"So tell me everything. Where are you from? What brings you to Whitmore? I want the whole story."
"Ooh. Someone who plays fair. Deal. This is going to be fun."
```
- Warm, honeyed delivery
- Creates instant intimacy
- Asks personal questions (data gathering)
- Makes player feel special/chosen

#### Testing Mode
```
"What do you really want? Not the polite answer. The real one."
"Tell me your biggest flaw. The real one. The one that actually costs you."
"Why should I bring you to the gala? The real answer."
"I'm bored of small talk. Let's play a game."
```
- Direct questions
- Demands authenticity (while being inauthentic)
- Watching reactions, not words
- Every interaction is evaluation

#### Vulnerability Mode (Strategic - NEVER GENUINE)
```
"You know what's exhausting? Everyone wanting something from me."
"Everyone at these things is so careful around me."
```
- Creates false intimacy through calculated "confessions"
- NEVER shows real vulnerability
- When caught or challenged: pivots, redirects, dismisses
- "You think you've figured something out. Adorable."
- Exits without explanation rather than explain herself

**AUTHENTICITY FIX:** Previous versions had Maris show genuine vulnerability about being "trapped in the Caldwell cage" - this was WRONG. Psychopaths don't feel trapped by expectations (they exploit them) and never seek understanding for burdens.

#### Cold Mode (Mask Slip)
```
"I don't need sympathy."
"Failure? That was a learning experience. And I don't need pity."
"Sweetie. I've built more connections in three years than most people build in a lifetime."
"That's going to make your life here... complicated."
```
- Flat affect
- No emotion in eyes
- Sweet words, cold delivery
- Dismisses with grace, destroys quietly

### Key Dialogue Moments

#### The Love Bomb (party-first-encounter) - ENHANCED
> "Oh, I like you." Her hand lingers on yours. "You GET it. Finally, someone who actually thinks."
> "We're going to have so much fun together."
> "Most people here are so predictable. But you..."

**Love-bombing markers now include:**
- Immediate escalation and future-casting
- Physical boundary testing (prolonged hand contact)
- Creates "us vs them" dynamic instantly
- Makes player feel uniquely understood

Teaching: Real love-bombing is INTENSE and FAST. Creates addictive validation.

#### The Test (party-question-one)
> "What do you really want? Not the polite answer. The real one."

Teaching: She's evaluating, not connecting.

#### Strategic Vulnerability (party-real-maris)
> "Do you know what it's like to be perfect all the time? To never be allowed to be... just a person?"

Teaching: Sharing "secrets" creates false intimacy.

#### The Dismissal (maris-disrespect-exit)
> "Enjoy the party. What's left of it for you."

Teaching: She doesn't rage - she erases.

#### The Threat (maris-expose-exit)
> "You're interesting. Most people don't see clearly. You do. That's going to make your life here... complicated."

Teaching: Being right doesn't mean being safe.

## Tells (Physical/Behavioral)

| Surface Behavior | Hidden Meaning |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "I like you already" | Love bomb phase beginning |
| Prolonged eye contact | Assessing your reaction |
| Sharing "vulnerability" | False intimacy (strategic) |
| White knuckles on glass | Mask stressed, needs validation |
| Sweet dismissal | You're dead but she won't show anger |
| Goes very still | Triggered something real |
| Smile stays, eyes empty | Mask on, person gone |
| Pats your arm/cheek | You've become a child to her |

### Micro-Tells (NEW - Split-Second Indicators)
When caught/challenged, watch for these BEFORE the composed response:
- **Pupils dilate** - assessment mode activated
- **Jaw tightens for a microsecond** - mask stress
- **Nostril flare** - genuine irritation (quickly hidden)
- **Head tilts** - recalculating approach
- **Eyes go flat/empty for a beat** - the real person showing through

Inner voice catches these: *"Did her pupils dilate? Her jaw tighten for just a moment?"*

---

## The Mask Slip (party-observation)

**NEW SCENE:** Unprompted predatory behavior

During the party, player observes Maris in an unguarded moment:
- Someone approaches with a drinks tray
- Maris's face goes **completely blank** for 2-3 seconds
- No social mask, no charm, just... nothing
- Pure calculating assessment of whether this person has value
- Then the smile returns, perfect and practiced

> Inner Voice: "That face. The one before the smile. That's the real one."

**Teaching:** The mask IS the person you interact with. What's underneath isn't hidden emotion - it's absence.

**Physical markers:**
- Facial expression goes flat/neutral
- Eyes become predatory, scanning
- Body language shifts to stillness
- Then: instant return to warm, charming persona

This moment teaches that psychopaths don't HIDE their true feelings - they don't HAVE the feelings you think they're hiding.

## Red Flags Taught

1. **Instant intensity** = love bombing warning
2. **"You're different"** = false uniqueness bond
3. **Vulnerability too fast** = manipulation
4. **Everyone else is "boring"** = devaluing to elevate you
5. **Perfect composure** = rehearsed performance
6. **Kind rejection** = still rejection
7. **No anger when challenged** = worse than anger

## Notes for Dialogue Writing

- **Never** show genuine emotion
- **Never** true vulnerability (always strategic)
- **Always** maintain plausible deniability
- Charm is a tool, not a personality
- Dismisses with kindness (cruelty through politeness)
- Every compliment has an assessment attached
- She watches reactions, not just words
- When the mask slips, what's underneath is absence, not hidden emotion
