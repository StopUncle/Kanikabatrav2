## Clinical Profile

### DSM-5 Markers (NPD Grandiose)
- Extreme sense of entitlement
- Expects automatic deference
- Dismissive of those "beneath" station
- Grandiose self-image reinforced by generational wealth
- Uses condescension as natural mode

### Key Difference from Victoria
Victor's narcissism is OLDER, more established. He doesn't need to prove superiority - he assumes it as natural law. Victoria still fights for position; Victor simply occupies it.

### Core Stance
**Patrician indifference** - You are not worth strong emotions. Approval or disapproval delivered with same detached tone.

```
