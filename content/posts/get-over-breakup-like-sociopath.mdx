# How to Get Over a Breakup Like a Sociopath

I don't experience breakups the way you do.

When a relationship ends, I don't spend weeks crying. I don't obsessively check their social media. I don't replay every conversation wondering what I did wrong.

I just... move on.

Before you decide this makes me a monster, consider: maybe there's something useful here. Maybe the way most people handle breakups—drowning in emotion, losing months of productivity, begging for closure—isn't the healthiest approach either.

So let me share how I do it. Take what works for you.

## The Fundamental Difference

Most people experience breakups as loss. The relationship ends, and they mourn it like a death.

I experience breakups as transition. A chapter closes, another opens. The emotional weight you carry? I simply don't generate it.

This isn't about being heartless. It's about how attachment works differently in my brain. And while you can't rewire your neurology, you can borrow some strategies.

## Strategy 1: Compartmentalize Ruthlessly

When the relationship ends, I put it in a mental box and close the lid.

This doesn't mean suppressing emotions—it means giving them a designated time and space. For you, this might look like:

- **Schedule your grief.** Give yourself 30 minutes each day to feel everything. Outside that window, redirect your thoughts.
- **Physical separation helps.** Remove their stuff from your space. Archive photos, don't delete them—but get them off your main feed.
- **Change your environment.** Rearrange furniture. Take a different route to work. Break the physical patterns associated with them.

The goal isn't to never feel. It's to stop the feelings from bleeding into every moment.

## Strategy 2: Cut Information Supply

I don't check on exes. Not their social media, not their friends' updates, nothing.

Every piece of information about them keeps the wound open. You're not moving on—you're maintaining connection through surveillance.

**Practical steps:**
- Block or mute them on all platforms (blocking is cleaner)
- Unfollow mutual friends if needed
- Ask your friends not to update you about them
- Install website blockers if you can't trust yourself

Information about your ex serves no purpose except keeping you stuck.

## Strategy 3: Replace the Habit, Not the Person

Relationships are routines. When they end, you're not just losing a person—you're losing structure.

Instead of trying to fill the person-shaped hole, fill the time-shaped hole:

- **Morning texts with them?** Start a morning journaling practice instead.
- **Dinner together?** Join a weekly class during that time slot.
- **Weekend activities?** Pick up something new that you couldn't do before.

You're not replacing them with another person. You're rebuilding your routine around you instead of around them.

## Strategy 4: Reframe the Narrative

I don't tell myself stories about "the one that got away" or "what could have been."

The story I tell is simple: "That didn't work. Something else will."

Your narrative matters. If you're repeating:
- "I'll never find someone like them"
- "I ruined everything"
- "They were my soulmate"

You're choosing to suffer. Try instead:
- "This relationship taught me what I do and don't want"
- "We weren't compatible long-term"
- "I'm now available for something better aligned"

The relationship ended. That's a fact. The story you tell about it is a choice.

## Strategy 5: Focus on the Relief

After every breakup, there's relief. Find it.

Maybe it's:
- Not walking on eggshells anymore
- Having your time back
- Not managing their moods
- Freedom to do what they didn't like
- Space to grow in directions they didn't support

The relationship wasn't perfect. Nothing is. Identify what's actually better now and focus there.

## Strategy 6: Upgrade Your Life Immediately

This is my favorite strategy. The moment a relationship ends, I improve something about my life.

- Start that workout routine
- Learn that skill
- Take that trip
- Make that career move
- Fix that thing about yourself you've been ignoring

Post-breakup is actually the perfect time for reinvention. Use the energy. Channel the pain into progress.

When you run into them months later, you should have visibly leveled up.

## Strategy 7: Don't Seek Closure

Closure is a myth. You don't need one final conversation to move on. You don't need them to understand. You don't need their validation.

Seeking closure keeps you connected. It's an excuse to maintain contact, to hope they'll say the magic words that make everything make sense.

Here's the truth: closure comes from you, not from them. It comes from deciding you're done, not from a satisfying ending to the story.

## Strategy 8: Understand Their Replacability

This sounds harsh, but it's freeing: they are replaceable.

The connection you had? You can have that with someone else.
The inside jokes? You'll create new ones.
The history? You'll build new history.

No one is so unique that they can't be matched. The 8 billion people on this planet include many who could give you what that relationship gave you—and probably more.

## Strategy 9: Embrace Boredom

The early weeks will feel empty. That's normal. You've been getting dopamine hits from the relationship, and now you're in withdrawal.

Don't immediately seek replacement stimulation through rebounds or substances. Sit with the boredom. Let your brain recalibrate.

The emptiness is temporary. Filling it with the wrong things extends the recovery.

## Strategy 10: Set a Hard Deadline

I give myself a defined period to process any emotional situation. Then I'm done.

Give yourself permission to grieve—but set an end date. After that date:
- No more talking about them
- No more "processing"
- No more dwelling

Is this arbitrary? Yes. Does it work? Absolutely. Your brain needs to know that this phase ends.

## The Controversial Truth

Here's what I genuinely believe: most extended breakup suffering is self-indulgent.

I don't say that to be cruel. I say it because I've watched people extend their pain for months, even years, by choosing to stay in it.

Every day you wake up and decide to think about your ex is a choice. Every time you check their profile is a choice. Every hour spent analyzing what went wrong is a choice.

You have more control over this than you think. You're just not exercising it.

## What You Can't Borrow

I should be honest about the limitations. Some things about my experience aren't transferable:

- I don't form the same emotional bonds, so I have less to detach from
- My reduced empathy means I don't feel their pain on top of my own
- My emotional baseline is already lower, so the drop feels less dramatic

You will feel things I don't. That's not a weakness—it's what makes you capable of the deep connections I struggle with.

But you can still move on faster. You can still choose not to suffer indefinitely. You can still take control of your mental space.

## Final Thoughts

Your ex is not thinking about you as much as you're thinking about them. They're probably already moving on. Why aren't you?

Every minute spent dwelling is a minute not spent building the life you want. Every tear over the past is energy not invested in the future.

Get over them. Not because they don't matter, but because you do.
