# Love Bombing: 10 Warning Signs You're Being Manipulated

Love bombing feels incredible. That's why it works.

When someone showers you with attention, affection, and adoration from day one, your brain releases dopamine like you've won the lottery. You feel special. Chosen. Finally seen.

But I need you to understand something: **that intensity isn't love. It's a strategy.**

I know because I've used it.

## What is Love Bombing?

Love bombing is a manipulation tactic where someone overwhelms you with excessive attention, affection, and apparent devotion early in a relationship. The goal is to create rapid emotional dependency so you're invested before you see their true nature.

It's used by:
- People with Cluster B personality disorders (ASPD, NPD, BPD)
- Cult leaders
- Abusers establishing control
- Anyone seeking to manipulate through emotional hooks

## The 10 Warning Signs

### 1. Overwhelming Intensity from Day One

They're texting constantly, calling multiple times a day, wanting to see you every moment. This isn't enthusiasm—it's a campaign.

**Red flag:** If someone you just met is treating you like you're already in a serious relationship, question why.

### 2. Premature "Soul Mate" Declarations

"I've never felt this way before."
"You're different from everyone else."
"I think I'm falling in love with you."

These statements in the first few weeks? Manufactured intimacy.

### 3. Excessive Gift-Giving

Expensive presents, surprise trips, lavish gestures—all before you've established a real connection. This creates a sense of obligation and debt.

### 4. Constant Flattery

Every word out of your mouth is brilliant. Every photo is stunning. You can do no wrong. This level of idealization isn't realistic—it's grooming.

### 5. Future Faking

Planning your life together when you've known each other weeks. Discussing marriage, children, moving in together. They're selling you a fantasy.

### 6. Wanting All Your Time

They subtly (or not so subtly) discourage time with friends and family. They want to monopolize your attention before others can warn you.

### 7. Mirroring Everything About You

They like everything you like. Share all your values. Have the same dreams. They're reflecting back what you want to see—it's not real compatibility.

### 8. Ignoring Your Boundaries

When you set limits, they push back with more affection. "I just like you so much." Boundary violation disguised as enthusiasm.

### 9. Creating Emotional Dependency

The highs are so high that you become addicted to their attention. When they pull back (and they will), you'll do anything to get that feeling back.

### 10. Too Good to Be True

Trust that instinct. If it feels like a movie, you might be an actor in someone else's script.

## What Comes After Love Bombing

The devastating truth is that love bombing is just phase one. What follows is typically:

1. **Devaluation:** The constant praise becomes criticism. The attention becomes withdrawal.
2. **Intermittent reinforcement:** Brief returns to the "love" phase keep you hooked.
3. **Discard:** When you're no longer useful or they've found a new target.

## How to Protect Yourself

- **Slow things down.** Real love can wait. Manipulation can't.
- **Maintain your other relationships.** Don't let anyone isolate you.
- **Watch actions over time.** Consistency matters more than intensity.
- **Trust your discomfort.** If it feels overwhelming, it probably is.
- **Ask yourself:** Would I accept this pace from anyone else?

## My Perspective

I've love bombed people. I'm not proud of it, but I understand the mechanism from the inside. It works because it exploits your natural desire to be loved and valued.

The person love bombing you may not even be consciously manipulative—for those with certain personality disorders, it can be automatic behavior. That doesn't make it less harmful to you.

The best defense is awareness. Now you know what it looks like.
