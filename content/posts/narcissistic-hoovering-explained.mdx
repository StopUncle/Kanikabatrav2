# Narcissistic Hoovering: When Your Ex Tries to Suck You Back In

You finally left. You blocked them. You started healing.

Then out of nowhere: a text from a new number. A "accidental" run-in. A mutual friend casually mentioning they've been asking about you. An email that somehow bypasses your filters.

**This is hoovering.** And understanding it is the difference between freedom and another cycle of abuse.

## What is Hoovering?

Named after the vacuum brand, hoovering describes the tactics narcissists use to "suck" former partners back into relationships. It typically happens when:

- You've established boundaries
- You've gone no contact
- They've lost their current source of supply
- They sense you're moving on
- A significant date approaches (holidays, anniversaries)

Hoovering isn't about love. It's about **control and supply**.

## The Different Types of Hoovering

### The "Changed Person" Approach

"I've been going to therapy."
"I finally understand what I did wrong."
"I'm a different person now."

This is the most seductive form because it offers what you always wanted: acknowledgment and growth. But words are cheap, and narcissists are excellent actors.

**Reality check:** Genuine change takes years, not the weeks or months since you left.

### The Emergency

"I'm in the hospital."
"My mom died."
"I lost my job and have nowhere to go."

Real or fabricated, emergencies exploit your empathy. They know you'll respond to crisis because you're a caring person.

**Reality check:** They have other people in their life. You're not their only option—you're their preferred source of supply.

### The "Accidental" Contact

Running into you at places you frequent. Showing up at events they know you'll attend. "Accidentally" liking old social media posts.

**Reality check:** These "coincidences" are calculated. They're monitoring you more than you know.

### The Guilt Trip

"I can't live without you."
"You're the only one who understands me."
"I've never loved anyone the way I loved you."

This puts the burden of their wellbeing on your shoulders.

**Reality check:** They survived before you. They'll survive after you.

### The Flying Monkeys

Using mutual friends, family, or even your own family to relay messages:

"They seem really sorry."
"They're really struggling without you."
"Maybe you should give them another chance."

**Reality check:** These people don't know what happened behind closed doors. Your boundaries are valid.

### The Grand Gesture

Expensive gifts. Public declarations. Promises of everything you ever wanted.

**Reality check:** This intensity should look familiar. It's love bombing 2.0.

### The Threat

When charm fails, they may switch to intimidation:

"I'll tell everyone what you really are."
"You'll never find someone like me."
"I'll make your life difficult."

**Reality check:** This reveals their true nature. Document everything.

## Why Hoovering Works

Hoovering exploits several psychological vulnerabilities:

### Trauma Bonding
The cycle of abuse and reconciliation creates chemical addiction. Your brain craves the highs even as it fears the lows.

### Cognitive Dissonance
You want to believe they've changed because the alternative—that the relationship was always doomed—is painful to accept.

### Nostalgia Bias
You remember the good times more vividly than the bad. They're counting on this.

### Empathy
Your capacity for understanding and forgiveness, which makes you a good person, also makes you vulnerable.

### Sunk Cost Fallacy
"We've been through so much together. Maybe this time will be different."

## How to Resist

### 1. Remember Why You Left

Write down the worst moments. The manipulation. The lies. The pain. Read this list when they contact you.

### 2. Understand the Pattern

This isn't new behavior. Look back—they've likely hoovered before, whether with you or previous partners. The cycle is: idealize, devalue, discard, hoover, repeat.

### 3. Maintain No Contact

Every response, even negative, gives them supply. Block new numbers. Don't engage with flying monkeys. Create a folder for their emails but don't read them.

### 4. Wait 72 Hours

If you feel compelled to respond, wait three days. The emotional urgency will fade, and you'll see the manipulation more clearly.

### 5. Talk to Someone Who Knows

Not a flying monkey—someone who witnessed the abuse. Let them remind you of reality when your brain wants to rewrite history.

### 6. Don't Explain

You don't owe them closure. Explanations just give them ammunition for further manipulation.

### 7. Document Everything

If they escalate to harassment, you'll need records. Save messages, note dates of contact, document any concerning behavior.

## The Hard Truth

Here's what I need you to understand:

**If they wanted to be better, they would have been better when they had you.**

The change they're promising now? It's the same promise they made last time. And the time before that.

Hoovering isn't about missing you. It's about missing what you provided: attention, stability, someone to control, someone to blame.

You are not their rehabilitation center. You're not responsible for their growth. Your job is to protect yourself.

## When You Feel Yourself Weakening

Ask yourself:
- What specifically will be different this time?
- What evidence do I have of sustained change?
- Why did they wait until I left to become "better"?
- Am I missing them or missing the fantasy of them?
- Would I advise a friend to go back?

## Moving Forward

The urge to respond will fade. The trauma bond will weaken. But only if you maintain distance.

Every day of no contact is a day of healing. Every ignored message is a boundary reinforced. Every time you choose yourself over their manipulation, you get stronger.

They're hoovering because it's worked before. Show them it won't work anymore.
